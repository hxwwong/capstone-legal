ESTATE OF SUSANO J. RODRIGUEZ, represented by its ATTORNEY-IN-FACT VIRGILIO R. VALENZUELA, petitioner, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, represented by the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, respondents.
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
Challenged in this petition 1 for review on certiorari are the February 20, 2014 Decision 2 and the September 16, 2014 Resolution 3 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 98892, that reversed and set aside the March 14, 2012 Decision 4 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 31 of Pili, Camarines Sur, in Civil Case No. P-2510. HTcADC
The CA dismissed 5 the complaint filed by petitioner Estate of Susano J. Rodriguez (estate), represented by its attorney-in-fact, Virgilio R. Valenzuela (Valenzuela), against the respondent Republic of the Philippines (Republic), represented by the Department of Health (DOH).
The Antecedents:
On September 12, 1968, Susano J. Rodriguez (Rodriguez) executed a deed of conditional donation 6 in favor of the Republic over a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 7800 located in Barangay Cadlan, Pili, Camarines Sur with an area of 322,839 square meters (sqm), for the purpose of constructing thereon a mental facility, subject to the following conditions:
1. That the property herein donated shall be used exclusively as site of the Mental Hospital for the Bicol Region upon which the DONEE shall construct and erect the different concrete buildings of said hospital;
2. That the DONEE in token of its appreciation and gratefulness for the kindness and generosity of the DONOR, and to perpetuate the memory of the humanitarian acts of the latter, shall name the said hospital as ""DON SUSANO J. RODRIGUEZ MEMORIAL MENTAL HOSPITAL"";
3. That the DONEE shall commence and finish the construction of the various concrete structures or concrete buildings necessary for the operation of the said hospital within the period of TWO (2) years from the date of execution of this Deed of Donation;
4. That the DONEE shall construct a concrete road from the main National Highway going to the site of the said hospital within the same period provided in the immediately preceding paragraph;
5. That the DONEE shall not under any circumstance or in any manner Lease, Let, Convey, Dispose, or Encumber the property herein donated or any part or portion thereof to any person or entity, except with the prior and express knowledge and approval of the DONOR, it being the desire and intention of the latter to have the said property for the exclusive use of the said hospital and FINALLY;
6. That title to the property herein donated shall remain with the Donor until all the conditions hereinabove set forth have been complied with, and that the violation and/or failure to comply by the DONEE with any or all of the conditions provided in the last preceding (six) paragraphs shall automatically and without formality REVOKE and CANCEL this donation and shall render the same as null and void ab initio as if it has never been executed, in the first place, and that title over the property herein donated shall ipso facto revert to the DONOR his heirs, successors and assigns and all improvements, structures or buildings introduced or constructed therein by the DONEE shall be forfeited in favor of the DONOR with all the rights, title and ownership over the said improvements, structures or buildings likewise reverting to the DONOR. 7
On September 29, 2008, the estate, represented by its attorney-in-fact Valenzuela, filed a complaint 8 against the Republic for revocation of the donation and forfeiture of improvements. It alleged that the Republic allowed a portion of the donated property to be used for residential and commercial purposes in violation of the fifth condition in the deed of conditional donation. 9
In its answer, 10 the Republic alleged that the RTC had no jurisdiction over petitioner's complaint as an estate has no legal capacity to sue and could not be a party to a court action. In addition, the estate's cause of action had already prescribed. As an onerous donation, the same is governed by the law on contracts. Article 1144 of the Civil Code provides that an action upon a written contract must be brought within 10 years from the time the right of action accrues. The Republic argued that since the deed of conditional donation was executed on September 12, 1968, an action to enforce the conditions therein prescribed on September 12, 1978. Hence, petitioner's filing of the instant complaint in 2008 is already barred by prescription. 11
Lastly, the Republic contended that the condition in the deed that the subject property cannot in any manner be leased, let, conveyed, disposed or encumbered without the prior and express knowledge and approval of the donor, constitutes undue restriction on the rights arising from ownership of the Republic, and thus, contrary to public policy. 12
Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.
Ruling of the Regional Trial
Court:
On March 14, 2012, the RTC rendered its Decision 13 revoking and cancelling the deed of conditional donation in so far as the 27 hectares of the 32 hectares subject of donation are concerned. It ordered the Department of Health to execute a deed of reconveyance for the 27 hectares, representing the unused portion of the land, in favor of the heirs of Rodriguez. 14
It held that since the donation is an onerous one, the provisions of the Civil Code governing contracts shall apply. The deed of conditional donation provided that the Republic must comply with the conditions within two years from execution. The computation of the 10-year prescriptive period under Article 1144 of the Civil Code with respect to actions upon a written contract shall commence from the time reasonable opportunity was afforded the Republic to fulfill the condition. 15
According to the RTC, the estate's cause of action accrued when the Republic failed to have the RTC's Decision in Civil Case No. P-86, an ejectment suit filed by the Republic against the informal settlers in the subject property, which was decided in favor of the Republic, and affirmed by the CA in its Decision dated February 28, 1995, be executed. More than 10 years have lapsed since the finality of the said Decision, but the Republic has yet to execute the same. 16
As such, the Republic is estopped by laches or negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time as it failed to move for execution of the judgment within five years from finality or move for the revival of the judgment within 10 years. Thus, when the estate filed the instant complaint on September 29, 2008, the estate is well within the 10-year prescriptive period to file an action on a written contract counted from the failure of the Republic to execute the judgment in its favor in Civil Case No. P-86.
Moreover, the stipulation in the Deed of Conditional Donation that the donation would be automatically revoked without need of resort to a judicial action if the donee failed to abide by the conditions 17 is valid. 18 Nonetheless, although there is automatic reversion upon violation of the contract, judicial intervention may be warranted by the aggrieved party for the purpose of determining the propriety thereof. 19
The RTC upheld Rodriguez's ownership of the subject property. It found the parties' stipulation, that title to the subject property shall remain with Rodriguez until the Republic shall have fully complied with the conditions set forth in the donation, as valid and not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order and public policy. 20
The Republic is not prohibited from registering in its name title to subject property provided it complies with the conditions of the donation. The RTC emphasized that the Republic has not made any move to register the subject property in its name. Its possession, even for a considerable length of time, will not ripen into ownership.
Forty (40) years have lapsed from the construction of the hospital and more than ten (10) years from the finality of Civil Case No. P-86 but the Republic has still not taken any legal action to eject the informal settlers. The Republic's complacency and unreasonable delay showed that it had no intention of introducing further development in the subject property. Hence, since the Republic only utilized five hectares out of the 32 hectares donated by Rodriguez, the RTC ruled that the remaining 27 hectares be reverted to the heirs of Rodriguez. 21
A motion for reconsideration 22 was filed by the Republic but it was denied by the RTC in its Order dated May 3, 2012. 23
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
In its assailed February 20, 2014 Decision, 24 the CA reversed and set aside the RTC's March 14, 2012 Decision, to wit:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated March 14, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court of Pili, Camarines Sur, Branch 31, in Civil Case No. P-2510 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, Plaintiff-Appellee's Complaint is DISMISSED.
SO ORDERED. 25
The CA found that the estate has legal personality to institute the present action. Section 2, Rule 87 of the Rules of Court permits an administrator to bring suits for the recovery of property belonging to the estate. Florencio E. Rodriguez, the administrator of the estate of Rodriguez, authorized Valenzuela, through a Special Power of Attorney, to represent the estate in the action for revocation of the deed of conditional donation. 26
Moreover, the CA ruled that the RTC erred in ruling that the title to the subject property is still under the name of Rodriguez. According to the CA, both parties did not present the title over the subject property and there was no stipulation as to who is the present registered owner thereof. In addition, it held that registration under the Torrens system is not a mode of acquiring ownership but merely an evidence of ownership. 27
As to the validity of the condition against alienation of the subject property, the CA ruled that since the deed of conditional donation did not expressly state the duration of the prohibition, it means that it was perpetual or for an indefinite period hence, illegal for being an impossible condition contemplated under Article 727 of the Civil Code.Thus, it must be considered as not imposed. 28
Even granting that said condition is valid, still there was no violation on the part of the Republic since it did not lease, let, dispose or encumber the subject property. The CA disagreed with the RTC that the Republic's refusal to execute the Decision in Civil Case No. P-86 is tantamount to tolerance of the occupation of the informal settlers in violation of the conditions of the donation. 29
First, the informal settlers on the subject land had been occupying the subject property as tenants of Rodriguez even before the execution of the deed of conditional donation. Second, there is reason to believe the testimony of Elpidio R. Sorellano (Sorellano) that Rodriguez knew of their occupation of the subject property from the execution of the donation in 1968 until his death when he did not revoke the donation. Third, the Republic sufficiently explained why the Decision in Civil Case No P-86 was not executed. 30
In any event, the non-execution of the Decision in Civil Case No. P-86 did not amount to a substantial breach of the deed of conditional donation; it may only be considered a casual breach not warranting the revocation of the donation. Article 1191 of the Civil Code provides that the breach of the conditions must be substantial as to defeat the purpose for which the contract was perfected. 31
In this case, the CA found that the Republic is still carrying out the purpose for which the donation was made, that is, the operation of a mental hospital. Despite the filing of a complaint for recovery of possession, these informal settlers hindered the execution of the Decision in Civil Case No. P-86 in favor of the Republic which is beyond the latter's control. 32
The estate filed a motion for reconsideration 33 which was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated September 16, 2014. 34
Hence, this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.
Issues:
The estate raised the following issues:
1. Whether or not the [CA] erred in its finding that the fifth condition of the Deed of Conditional Donation is void for being an absolute prohibition to lease, convey, dispose or encumber the subject land contrary to the clear intention of the donor to restrict only the benefit derived from the donated land exclusively for its use as mental hospital without affecting the right of ownership of the [Republic];
2. Whether or not the [CA] erred in holding that the failure of the [Republic] to execute the decision in the ejectment case against the informal settlers (who use the land as residential and business place) constitute (sic) tolerance of possession x x x and a violation of the prohibition and undertaking x x x in the Deed of Conditional Donation that the land shall not be allowed to be used for any other purpose except as a Mental Hospital;
3. Whether or not the CA erred in finding that the violation of the fifth condition in the Deed of Conditional Donation does not constitute a substantial breach that warrants revocation of the donation when only 5 hectares is used for the mental hospital and the remaining 27 hectares is used as residences or business places of the informal settlers. 35
Our Ruling
After a judicious perusal of the records, the Court finds the petition without merit.
Prescription:
The deed of conditional donation expressly provided for the automatic revocation and/or reversion in case of breach of any of the conditions therein. If the donee fails to comply with or violate any of the conditions stated in the donation, the title over the subject property shall ipso facto revert to the donor, his heirs, successors or assigns and all improvements, structures or buildings thereon shall be forfeited in favor of the donor, thus:
6. That title to the property herein donated shall remain with the Donor until all the conditions hereinabove set forth have been complied with, and that the violation and/or failure to comply by the DONEE with any or all of the conditions provided in the last preceding (six) paragraphs shall automatically and without further formality REVOKE and CANCEL this donation and shall render the same as null and void ab initio as if it has never been executed, in the first place, and that title over the property herein donated shall ipso facto revert to the DONOR his heirs, successors and assigns and all improvements, structures or buildings introduced or constructed therein by the DONEE shall be forfeited in favor of the DONOR with all the rights, title and ownership over the said improvements, structures or buildings likewise reverting to the DONOR. 36
We upheld such provision in De Luna v. Abrigo 37 as it is in the nature of an agreement granting a party to rescind a contract in case of breach, without need of going to court; ""upon the happening of the resolutory condition or non-compliance with the conditions of the contract, the donation is automatically revoked without need of a judicial declaration to that effect."" 38
However, if the donee challenges the propriety thereof, the Court can conclusively settle whether the resolution is proper or not. 39 The judicial intervention is not for the purpose of obtaining a judicial declaration rescinding a contract already deemed rescinded by reason of the parties' agreement but in order to determine whether or not the rescission was proper. 40
In Republic v. Silim, 41 the Court distinguished four types of donation: (a) pure or simple; (b) remuneratory or compensatory; (c) conditional or modal; and (d) onerous, viz.:
Donations, according to its purpose or cause, may be categorized as: (1) pure or simple; (2) remuneratory or compensatory; (3) conditional or modal; and (4) onerous. A pure or simple donation is one where the underlying cause is plain gratuity. This is donation in its truest form. On the other hand, a remuneratory or compensatory donation is one made for the purpose of rewarding the donee for past services, which services do not amount to a demandable debt. A conditional or modal donation is one where the donation is made in consideration of future services or where the donor imposes certain conditions, limitations or charges upon the donee, the value of which is inferior than that of the donation given. Finally, an onerous donation is that which imposes upon the donee a reciprocal obligation or, to be more precise, this is the kind of donation made for a valuable consideration, the cost of which is equal to or more than the thing donated. 42
In the case at bar, the donation involved is an onerous one since the burden imposed upon the donee is to build a mental hospital on the donated property. Thus, the provisions of the Civil Code on the rules on contracts shall govern, 43 to wit:
ARTICLE 733. Donations with an onerous cause shall be governed by the rules on contracts, and remuneratory donations by the provisions of the present Title as regards that portion which exceeds the value of the burden imposed.
Article 1144 of the Civil Code provides that all actions upon a written contract shall be brought within ten (10) years from accrual of the right of action. Petitioner's complaint for revocation of the donation therefore has not yet prescribed since the cause of action accrued only upon the alleged failure of the Republic to comply with any or all of the conditions of the donation.
Although the deed of conditional donation contained a stipulation on the automatic revocation of donation in case of failure of the donee to comply with any or all of the conditions, the estate's complaint for revocation or action for rescission in behalf of the donor, Rodriguez, is a valid exercise of the latter's right to determine the propriety of the revocation. 44
A perusal of the records reveals that five out of the 32 hectares of land subject of the donation are being used by the Republic for the operation of its mental hospital, while a portion of the land is occupied by the informal settlers. In order to utilize the subject property exclusively for the use of the mental hospital, the Republic filed an ejectment case against the informal settlers in 1971 docketed as Civil Case No. P-86.
Thereafter, a judgment favorable to the Republic was rendered by the RTC in Civil Case No. P-86 45 that was affirmed by the CA in its February 28, 1995 Decision. 46 It became final and executory on March 27, 1995. 47 However, the Republic failed to have the Decision in Civil Case No. P-86 executed by filing a motion for execution within five years or a motion to revive the judgment within 10 years from the finality of Civil Case No. P-86.
Hence, the estate's complaint filed in 2007 is well within the prescriptive period, which is 10 years from the lapse of the period within which the Republic could file a motion for revival of judgment of Civil Case No. P-86 in 2005. As correctly ruled by the CA, the cause of action accrued only from the time of the alleged violation of the Republic, that is, its failure to comply with its obligation to not lease, let, encumber or dispose any portion of the donated property, i.e., its failure to move for execution or revival of judgment of Civil Case No. P-86, which resulted in the continuous occupation of the informal settlers on a portion of the donated property.
Is the fifth condition in the deed
of conditional donation valid?
The fifth condition in the deed of conditional donation states that:
5. That the DONEE shall not under any circumstance or in any manner Lease, Let, Convey, Dispose, or Encumber the property herein donated or any part or portion thereof to any person or entity, except with the prior and express knowledge and approval of the DONOR, it being the desire and intention of the latter to have the said property for the exclusive use of the said hospital and FINALLY. 48
It is clear from the foregoing that the Republic is prohibited from leasing, conveying, disposing or encumbering the donated property or any part thereof to any person or entity without the prior and express knowledge of the donor as the latter's intention of donating the property is for the exclusive use of the mental hospital to be built by the Republic.
In Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila v. Court of Appeals (Roman Catholic Archbishop), 49 the Court invalidated a provision in the deed of donation that the donated property should not be sold within a period of 100 years from the date of execution as it unduly restricts on the rights of ownership of the donee, to wit:
Nonetheless, we find that although the action filed by private respondents may not be dismissed by reason or prescription, the same should be dismissed on the ground that private respondents have no cause of action against petitioners.
The cause of action of private respondents is based on the alleged breach by petitioners of the resolutory condition in the deed of donation that the property donated should not be sold within a period of one hundred (100) years from the date of execution of the deed of donation. Said condition, in our opinion, constitutes an undue restriction on the rights arising from ownership of petitioners and is, therefore, contrary to public policy.
Donation, as a mode of acquiring ownership, results in an effective transfer of title over the property from the donor to the donee. Once a donation is accepted, the donee becomes the absolute owner of the property donated. Although the donor may impose certain conditions in the deed of donation, the same must not be contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order and public policy. The condition imposed in the deed of donation in the case before us constitutes a patently unreasonable and undue restriction on the right of the donee to dispose of the property donated, which right is an indispensable attribute of ownership. Such a prohibition against alienation, in order to be valid, must not be perpetual or for an unreasonable period of time.
Certain provisions of the Civil Code illustrative of the aforesaid policy may be considered applicable by analogy. Under the third paragraph of Article 494, a donor or testator may prohibit partition for a period which shall not exceed twenty (20) years. Article 870, on its part, declares that the dispositions of the testator declaring all or part of the estate inalienable for more than twenty (20) years are void. 50 [Emphasis ours.]
In the case at bar, the provision in the deed of conditional donation did not expressly state a period of restriction on the Republic's right to dispose of the donated property. It simply stated that the Republic could not lease, let, convey, dispose or encumber the donated property without the prior and express knowledge of the donor as it was the latter's intention to devote the use of the donated property exclusively for the mental hospital. 51
Applying by analogy the Roman Catholic Archbishop case, the donor could not unduly restrict the right of the donee to dispose the donated property perpetually or for an unreasonable period of time. The prohibition in the deed of donation that the Republic cannot lease, let, convey, dispose or encumber the donated property without specifying the duration of the restriction should be declared as an illegal or impossible condition within the contemplation of Article 727 of the Civil Code as it is contrary to public policy. Although the parties did not agree on the period of validity of the restriction as in Roman Catholic Archbishop, the same may be viewed as perpetual or permanent which constitutes undue restriction for unreasonable period of time. aScITE
Did the Republic violate the fifth
condition of the deed of
conditional donation?
We hold that the Republic did not violate the fifth condition in the deed of conditional donation. It filed an action for recovery of possession against the informal settlers on July 21, 1971, 52 or within three years from the date of execution of the donation in 1968, before the RTC of Pili, Camarines Sur, Branch 33 which was docketed as Civil Case No. P-86.
Thereafter, on May 15, 1991, the RTC of Pili, Camarines Sur, rendered its Decision 53 in Civil Case No. P-86 in favor of the Republic, to wit:
Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered:
1. Declaring the plaintiff Republic of the Philippines the owner with right of possession and enjoyment of the parcel of land described in paragraph 4 of the Re-Amended Complaint;
2. Ordering the defendants to vacate and to surrender to the plaintiff their respective landholdings as shown in the Relocation Plan marked as Exhibit B and appearing on page 171 of Vol. I of the Records of this case;
3. Ordering the defendants Maria Rellama, Victorio Atis, Eulogio Layosa represented by Juanito Altobar, Marcelino Doro, Elpidio Surillano, Hermogenes Kingking and other defendants who may have constructed houses or any buildings thereon to vacate and remove the same;
4. Ordering the cancellation of the Certificate of Land Transfer issued to Pedro Sario, Flaviano Gavino and Simplicio Doro, the same having unlawfully generated and illegally issued to them;
5. Ordering the dismissal of the counterclaim of the defendants and the intervenors the same not being meritorious; and
6. With costs against all the defendants and intervenors except the defendant Bienvenido Paladin who has already turned over one of his two lots to the plaintiff and who has already abandoned his other lot because of old age being already an octogenarian.
SO ORDERED. 54
On appeal, the CA in its February 28, 1995 Decision 55 affirmed in toto the RTC's Decision dated May 15, 1991. On March 27, 1995, the same became final and executory and on May 29, 1995 it was entered in the Book of Entries of Judgment. 56
Based on the foregoing, the Republic complied with the fifth condition of the donation by filing an ejectment case against the informal settlers in order to utilize the whole portion of the donated property for the exclusive use of the mental hospital in consonance with the condition imposed by the donor as stated in the deed of conditional donation. Its failure to have the judgment in Civil Case No. P-86 be executed within 10 years from March 27, 1995 could not be considered a violation of the fifth condition.
It bears stressing that the informal settlers were already in occupation or possession of a portion of the donated property upon the execution of the deed of conditional donation. Although the parties did not state or acknowledge the presence of the informal settlers on a portion of the donated property, the donor could not feign ignorance thereof considering that the defendants in Civil Case No. P-86 anchored their right to possession of the portion of donated property on their alleged tenancy relationship with the donor as found by the RTC in Civil Case No. P-86.
It would thus be unfair for the donor to impose a restriction on the Republic not to lease, let, dispose, convey or encumber the donated property when upon the execution of the donation, the donated property was actually occupied by third parties. Moreover, the deed of conditional donation is bereft of any statement or provision that the Republic assumed the liability of evicting the informal settlers from the donated property. Sorellano, a retired farmer and employee of Rodriguez, categorically admitted that he is presently occupying a portion of the donated property and even during the execution of the donation, to wit:
ATTY. VILLASERAN:
Q: Mr. Sorellano, as stated before you are living at Cadian, Pili, Camarines Sur, how long have you been living in that place?
A: Since 1942.
Q: Mr. Witness, when you entered the property where you are living right now, who owns the property at that time?
A: Don Susano Rodriguez.
Q: Mr. Witness, do you know who owns the property at this time?
A: If I'm not mistaken all I know that property was donated to the Mental Hospital.
THE COURT:
Q: You are being asked; if you know who is the owner of the land at this present time?
A: Don Susano Rodriguez.
ATTY. VILLASERAN:
Q: That was before but now, who owns the property now?
A: The owner is the Mental Hospital where I stayed as of today.
Q: Do you know how did the Mental Hospital acquire the subject property?
A: As I have said it was donated.
Q: Do you remember Mr. Witness when it was donated?
A: As if it was in 1968.
Q: Mr. Witness, do you know Don Susano Rodriguez personally?
A: Yes sir, because I worked for him in the fish pond. 57
Even so, it cannot be considered as failure on the part of the Republic to fully comply with the conditions of donation when it did not file a motion for execution or motion for revival of judgement in Civil Case No. P-86 within five and 10 years, respectively. The Republic was justified when it failed to have the judgment in Civil Case No. P-86 executed due to the threats of violence of the informal settlers. Nonetheless, its failure to have the judgment in Civil Case No. P-86 executed is not considered tolerance on its part within the contemplation of law.
Again, it is undisputed that a portion of the donated property was occupied by third parties when the deed of conditional donation was executed. The Republic had no participation in the occupation therein of these informal settlers. It did not lease, let, dispose, convey or encumber such portion of the donated property to these informal settlers or any other person.
Hence, We cannot impute tolerance upon the Republic when it failed to file a motion for execution or motion for revival of judgment when it validly exercised its right over the donated property immediately after the execution of the donation by filing an ejectment case.
Besides, the alleged tolerance by the Republic of the occupation of the informal settlers of a portion of the donated property is not what is contemplated by the provisions of the fifth condition. The leasing, letting, disposing, conveying or encumbering requires an explicit act from the Republic which would therefore render the donation invalid.
Here, aside from the Republic's failure to execute the judgment in Civil Case No. P-86, the estate did not present any evidence to prove that the Republic indeed actively entered into an agreement with any person to lease, let, dispose, convey or encumber any portion of the donated property.
Even assuming that the Republic's failure to move for execution of judgment in Civil Case No. P-86 is deemed an act of tolerance or encumbrance on the donated property, the same could not be considered as a substantial breach warranting rescission of the donation. Article 1191 of the Civil Code provides that:
Art. 1191. The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.
The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case. He may also seek rescission, even after he has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.
The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.
This is understood to be without prejudice to the rights of third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with Articles 1385 and 1388 and the Mortgage Law.
In general, rescission will not be permitted for a slight or casual breach of the contract, buy only for such breaches that are substantial and fundamental as to defeat the object of the parties in making the agreement. 58 The right to rescind or resolve by the injured party is not absolute as the third paragraph of Article 1191 authorizes the court to fix a period. Hence, rescission will not be granted in the following: (1) where the breach is only slight or casual; (2) where there has been substantial compliance; and (3) where the court finds valid reason for giving a period of fulfillment of the obligation. 59
To stress, the failure on the part of the Republic to move for execution within five years or to move for revival within 10 years of the judgment in Civil Case No. P-86 could not be considered as a substantial breach. The informal settlers were already occupying a portion of the donated property when the deed of donation was executed. Republic's act of filing of an ejectment suit signifies its non-tolerance of the occupation of the informal settlers.
Moreover, the deed of conditional donation did not categorically oblige the Republic to undertake recovery of possession of the portion of the donated property from these informal settlers. What was prohibited in the fifth condition was the leasing, letting, disposal, conveyance or encumbering of the donated property or any portion thereof without the prior and express knowledge and approval of the donor.
Rodriguez is presumed to have been aware of the presence of the informal settlers when he executed the deed of donation. This thus negates the claim that the Republic did violate the fifth condition of the deed of conditional donation.
The Republic already complied with the main prestation of the deed of conditional donation which is the construction of the mental hospital and a concrete road from the national highway to the hospital. Although the buildings and improvements sit only on five hectares out of the 32 hectares donated property, the same can be considered as substantial compliance as the deed of conditional donation did not specify the extent of the area that must be occupied by the buildings and other improvements or the size of the mental hospital. Further, the mental hospital continues to operate which clearly shows that the Republic satisfied the purpose of the donation, that is, to exclusively use the donated property for the construction and operation of a mental hospital.
While the Republic admitted that it failed to pursue the development plan for the utilization of the remaining portion of the subject property due to lack of funds, the construction of the hospital on the five hectare portion of the subject property constitutes substantial compliance with the condition of the donation, i.e., ""3. That the DONEE shall commence and finish the construction of the various concrete structures or concrete buildings necessary for the operation of the said hospital within the period of TWO (2) years from the date of execution of this Deed of Donation."" 60
Thus, although paragraph 1 of the deed of conditional donation states that ""That the property herein donated shall be used exclusively as site of the Mental Hospital for the Bicol Region upon which the DONEE shall construct and erect the different concrete buildings of said hospital""; 61 (underscoring ours) the deed did not specifically restrict or specify the extent of the area wherein these concrete buildings of the hospital will be erected. The deed of conditional donation merely states that the subject property shall be used exclusively as the site of the mental hospital for the Bicol Region but did not provide with specificity the size of the buildings the Republic should construct and in what particular portion of the property. Indeed, the Republic is restricted only as to the use of the subject property, i.e., the construction and operation of a mental hospital. Nowhere in the said deed of conditional donation did it compel the Republic to erect and construct buildings on every square inch of the 32-hectare property. In fact, paragraph 3 of the deed states that the Republic is obliged to ""commence and finish the construction of the various concrete structures or concrete buildings necessary for the operation of the said hospital"" 62 (underscoring ours) which it successfully and faithfully complied.
In Republic v. Silim, 63 the Court defines the term ""exclusive"" in this wise:
What does the phrase ""exclusively used for school purposes"" convey? ""School"" is simply an institution or place of education. ""Purpose"" is defined as ""that which one sets before him to accomplish or attain; an end, intention, or aim, object, plan, project. Term is synonymous with the ends sought, an object to be attained, an intention, etc."" ""Exclusive"" means ""excluding or having power to exclude (as by preventing entrance or debarring from possession, participation, or use); limiting or limited to possession, control or use."" 64 (Emphasis and underscoring ours)
What the deed requires is that the whole subject property shall be exclusively dedicated for the operation of a mental hospital. 65 Thus, the Republic cannot allocate any portion of the subject property to any purpose other than the operation of a mental hospital. In this regard, paragraph 5 of the deed prohibits the Republic from leasing, letting, conveying, disposing or encumbering the subject property or any part or portion thereof unless with the prior and express knowledge and approval of the donor. 66 As already discussed, the donor, Rodriguez, was aware of the presence of the informal settlers on the subject property when he executed the deed of donation thereby negating the claim that the Republic violated the paragraph 5 of the deed. The Republic cannot be faulted for its failure to move for execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. P-86 when the donor himself had prior and express knowledge and approval of the presence of the informal settlers on the subject property.
More importantly, the non-construction of buildings on the 27-hectare portion of the donated property did not defeat the purpose of the donation, i.e., the operation of a mental hospital. In fact, the Republic presently operates the mental hospital in accordance with the purpose of the donation and the wishes of the donor. With the Republic's compliance with the main prestation, i.e., construction of various buildings necessary for the operation of a mental hospital within two years from the execution of the deed, the revocation of the donation is improper and lacks legal basis.
Lastly, the Republic's failure to move for execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. P-86 is not tantamount to relinquishment of its ownership over the said portion of the donated property in favor of the informal settlers, which may constitute disposition or conveyance in violation of the deed of conditional donation. The doctrines of laches and estoppel are being invoked in relation to the issue of possession subject of Civil Case No. P-86 and not with respect to ownership. ""Prescription and laches cannot apply to registered land covered by the Torrens system because under the Property Registration Decree, no title to registered land in derogation to that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession."" 67
Evidently, the donated property is registered under the Torrens system, it being identified in the deed of conditional donation as covered by TCT No. 7800. Thus, the same can never be acquired by prescription and laches by the informal settlers therein. The Republic, therefore, did not commit any violation that would constitute as disposition or conveyance of its right of ownership over the portion of the donated property in favor of the informal settlers by its failure to move for execution or revival of Civil Case No. P-86.
WHEREFORE, the petition for review is hereby DENIED. The assailed February 20, 2014 Decision and September 16, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 98892, are hereby AFFIRMED. HEITAD

[G.R. No. 208258. April 27, 2022.]
MARIA VICIA CARULLO-PADUA, petitioner, vs. JOSELITO PADUA, respondent.
DECISION
HERNANDO, *** J p:
This petition for review on certiorari 1 seeks to set aside the August 28, 2006 Decision 2 and the November 14, 2011 Resolution 3 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 80952. The assailed Decision affirmed the September 2, 1999 Decision 4 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Las Piñas City, Branch 253, in Civil Case No. LP-97-0169, which denied the petition 5 for declaration of nullity of marriage filed by herein petitioner Maria Vicia Carullo-Padua (Maria) against respondent Joselito Padua (Joselito).
Factual Antecedents:
Maria and Joselito were married in a civil ceremony on February 5, 1982 followed by a church wedding on December 18, 1982. The union produced a son born on March 23, 1986. 6
On July 17, 1997, Maria filed a petition 7 for declaration of absolute nullity of their marriage with the trial court anchored on Article 36 of the Family Code. Maria alleged that at the time of the celebration of their marriage, Joselito was psychologically incapacitated to perform his marital obligations. During their cohabitation, Joselito exhibited excessive sexual desire and forced her to perform oral and anal sex with him; 8 that there were occasions when respondent attempted to sexually molest her sister, nieces and their household help who were staying with them; that respondent admitted to said attempts of molestations but begged her to keep said incidents a secret; 9 that Joselito misrepresented himself as a Roman Catholic when he was actually a born-again Christian; that when Maria refused to convert to Joselito's religion, he began insulting her religious beliefs, 10 and that at one point, at the heat of their quarrel, Joselito attempted to kill Maria by threatening to stab her with a letter opener. 11
Maria also alleged that Joselito failed to provide financial support for her and their child; that right after they got married, Joselito insisted that they stay in her parents' house so that he can give half of his salary to his own parents; that they were dependent on Maria's parents for support; 12 and that Joselito never bothered to share in the household expenses while they were living at her parents' house. Maria further claimed that when Joselito lost his job in 1985, he remained unemployed for six months because he did not try to find work until she asked him to look for one. 13
Joselito also failed to provide emotional and psychological support to their child. He preferred staying in their room rather than to spend time with their only son. Occasionally, he would physically harm their child when the latter would attempt to play with him. 14
Maria further averred that in 1990, Joselito left for Italy to work without consulting her. While working abroad, Joselito stopped sending financial support to her and their son after settling the huge debt he incurred here in the Philippines. Consequently, Maria raised and supported their son all by herself. Later, in 1992, Joselito sent a letter admitting to his shortcomings on their marital relationship and making known of his decision to sever ties with her and their son. However, when Joselito returned to the Philippines in 1997, he sought custody of their child who was under her care. 15
Upon the foregoing averments, Maria concluded that there is sufficient basis to declare Joselito psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations. Hence, Maria's marriage with Joselito should be declared null and void pursuant to Article 36 of the Family Code. 16
As Joselito did not file an answer, the court a quo ordered the public prosecutor to conduct an investigation to ensure that no collusion existed between the parties. 17
After the public prosecutor determined that there was no collusion between the parties, trial proceeded in Joselito's absence. 18 In its comment 19 dated December 3, 1997, the Office of the Solicitor General manifested its opposition to the petition.
During trial, petitioner presented herself and psychiatrist Dr. Cecilia Villegas (Dr. Villegas) as witnesses. Maria testified on the allegations contained in her petition 20 while Dr. Villegas testified on the personality evaluation 21 report she prepared. 22
Dr. Villegas testified that she diagnosed Joselito with a personality disorder of a sexual deviant or perversion based on Maria's narrations. Joselito's preference for anal and oral sex, as well as the molestations he committed against Maria's relatives and housemaid, were manifestations of Joselito's perversion. The root cause of Joselito's personality disorder is traceable to his wretched childhood. Inasmuch as Joselito spent his youth with a cruel father and a very protective mother, the unbalanced relationship between Joselito's parents developed some emotional confusion on him. As a result, Joselito's sexual development did not mature. Dr. Villegas added that the psychological disorder of Joselito is grave, serious and not clinically curable which rendered him psychologically incapacitated to perform his marital obligations. 23
Ruling of the Regional Trial
Court:
On September 2, 1999, the trial court denied the petition, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premised on the foregoing, the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage filed by Maria Vicia Carullo-Padua is DISMISSED for lack of merit and the marriage contract between said petitioner and Joselito Padua is declared VALID and SUBSISTING.
No costs.
SO ORDERED. 24
The trial court held that the evidence adduced by Maria failed to overcome the legal presumption in favor of the validity of her marriage with respondent. 25 It ratiocinated that:
x x x [T]he evidence presented by the petitioner only proves infidelity and sexual perversion of the respondent after the marriage and standing as it is, cannot be said to be a permanent sickness and so serious that the same prevented respondent from assuming his marital obligations. As a matter of fact, respondent was aware of and accepted that his infidelity and perversion were all his faults and he even asked forgiveness from petitioner in his letter dated 15 November 1992 (Exh. 'E'). Contrary to the contention of petitioner, respondent tried to be a good provider to his family as shown by the fact, as petitioner admitted herself (TSN, pp. 12-14, 24 September 1998), that respondent had a job although his earnings therefrom were not enough because he had to give one-half of his salary to his own parents for one reason or another. Nevertheless, petitioner and respondent, during their marriage, were still able to purchase a parcel of residential land of their own at T.S. Cruz Subdivision, Almanza, Las Pinas [sic] City (Exh. 'D').
Without discounting the truthfulness of the report and testimony of Dr. Cecilia Villegas to the effect that respondent suffers from a personality disorder of a sexual deviant or pervert type, this Court is of the considered view that the same is not supported by veritable proof that such disorder is so grave or serious as to incapacitate respondent from performing his marital obligations. Firstly, it is clear from the record that Dr. Villegas' evaluation and examination of respondent was based on the data and information supplied by petitioner herself (TSN, pp. 20-21, 11 January 1999), the very person interested in sustaining her petition; hence, the conclusions derived therefrom are of doubtful veracity. Secondly, the law requires that prior to the filing of the petition, there must be an occasion when either or both of the parties in a marriage contract has been found by a clinical or medical psychologist or psychiatrist to be suffering from psychological incapacity and such fact is to be averred in the petition. But as this petition stands here now, petitioner consulted Dr. Villegas only for the purpose of sustaining her petition (pp. 30-31, Ibid.); hence, the findings of Dr. Villegas cannot impartially render the legal aid the same is supposed to give to this Court to arrive at an impartial decision as said findings are tainted with legal infirmity."" 26
Maria appealed 27 before the appellate court.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
The appellate court sustained 28 the judgment of the trial court. CAIHTE
It held that the grounds relied upon by Maria to support her petition to declare the nullity of her marriage with Joselito, i.e., sexual perversion, abandonment, Joselito's attempt against her life, and sexual infidelity, assuming said circumstances to be true, are not grounds for annulment of the marriage but at best valid grounds for legal separation under Article 55 of the Family Code. 29
Maria moved for a reconsideration but it was denied in the appellate court's November 14, 2011 Resolution. 30
Hence, this recourse of petitioner hinged on the following grounds:
A. THE ASSAILED DECISION FAILED TO CONSIDER THE PETITION BASED ON THE UNDISPUTED EVIDENCE. RATHER IT WAS RESOLVED BASED ON A PRIORI PRESUMPTIONS AND GENERALIZATIONS.
B. SADISM IS A SEXUAL ANOMALY THAT RENDERS RESPONDENT PSYCHOLOGICALLY INCAPACITATED UNDER RULE (SIC) 36 OF THE FAMILY CODE.
C. PETITIONER PROVED WITH CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE RESPONDENT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL INCAPACITY, PERSONALITY DISORDER, DEVIANCE AND PERVERSION; AND SUCH PSYCHOLOGICAL INCAPACITY IS GRAVE, HAS JURIDICAL ANTECE[DE]NCE AND IS INCURABLE.
D. RESPONDENT, PROVEN TO BE A SEXUAL DEVIANT AND PERVERT, IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY INCAPACITATED TO PERFORM HIS ESSENTIAL MARITAL OBLIGATIONS TO PETITIONER. 31
Maria posits that the appellate court's judgment was based on priori assumptions and generalizations. 32 In affirming the denial of the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage, the appellate court simply made a pronouncement that ""Article 36 of the Family Code, as amended contemplates downright incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume the basic marital obligations, not a mere refusal, neglect or difficulty much less, ill will, on the part of the errant spouse"" 33 without explaining why Joselito's sexual sadism, abandonment and infidelity do not constitute psychological incapacity. 34
Maria claims that the CA erred in assuming that sexual perversion cannot be a ground for annulment of marriage because the same is a ground for legal separation. The appellate court failed to consider that the sexual sadism of Joselito affected the foundation of their marriage. Joselito's sadistic behavior of forcing Maria to perform anal sex with him, without regard to her feelings, showed that Joselito was patently incapable of fulfilling his marital duty of loving and respecting her. 35
The appellate court's disregard of the assessment of an expert witness on Joselito's personality disorder is contrary to settled jurisprudence that ""[b]y the very nature of Article 36, courts, despite having the primary task and burden of decision-making, must not discount but, instead, must consider as decisive evidence the expert opinion on the psychological and mental temperaments of the parties."" 36
Since it was clinically found that: (1) Joselito is a sexual deviant/sadist type, as manifested by his preference for anal and oral sex; and (2) that said personality disorder of Joselito is characterized by seriousness or gravity and incurability, it should be discernible that Joselito is not capable of adhering to a normal sex life. Maria asserts that one who unconsciously inflicts sexual violence on his wife, such as Joselito, is incapable of complying with the essential marital obligations of observing mutual love and respect. Having been declared by a psychiatrist that Joselito is not capacitated to understand or comply with the essential marital obligations, a declaration of nullity of their marriage is in order. 37
Issue:
The sole issue for resolution in this case is whether the totality of evidence presented by Maria is sufficient to prove that Joselito is psychologically incapacitated to perform his essential marital obligations, meriting the dissolution of his marriage with Maria.
Our Ruling
We answer in the negative.
Article 36 of the Family Code reads:
ART. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.
Republic v. Iyoy 38 instructs that the psychological incapacity must be characterized by:
(a) Gravity — It must be grave or serious such that the party would be incapable of carrying out the ordinary duties required in a marriage;
(b) Juridical Antecedence — It must be rooted in the history of the party antedating the marriage, although the overt manifestations may emerge only after the marriage; and
(c) Incurability — It must be incurable or, even fit were otherwise, the cure would be beyond the means of the party involved. 39
Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina 40 (Molina), provided the following guidelines in the interpretation and application of Article 36 of the Family Code, viz.:
(1) The burden of proof to show the nullity of the marriage belongs to the plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity. This is rooted in the fact that both our Constitution and our laws cherish the validity of marriage and unity of the family. Thus, our Constitution devotes an entire Article on the Family, recognizing it as the foundation of the nation. It decrees marriage as legally inviolable, thereby protecting it from dissolution at the whim of the parties. Both the family and marriage are to be protected by the state.
The Family Code echoes this constitutional edict on marriage and the family and emphasizes their permanence, inviolability and solidarity.
(2) The root cause of the psychological incapacity must be (a) medically or clinically identified, (b) alleged in the complaint, (c) sufficiently proven by experts and (d) clearly explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code requires that the incapacity must be psychological — not physical, although its manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical. The evidence must convince the court that the parties, or one of them, was mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that the person could not have known the obligations he was assuming, or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption thereof. Although no example of such incapacity need be given here so as not to limit the application of the provision under the principle of ejusdem generis, nevertheless such root cause must be identified as a psychological illness and its incapacitating nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by qualified psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.
(3) The incapacity must be proven to be existing at the time of the celebration of the marriage. The evidence must show that the illness was existing when the parties exchanged their I do's. The manifestation of the illness need not be perceivable at such time, but the illness itself must have attached at such moment, or prior thereto.
(4) Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent or incurable. Such incurability may be absolute or even relative only in regard to the other spouse, not necessarily absolutely against everyone of the same sex. Furthermore, such incapacity must be relevant to the assumption of marriage obligations, not necessarily to those not related to marriage, like the exercise of a profession or employment in a job x x x.
(5) Such illness must be grave enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Thus, mild characteriological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts cannot be accepted as root causes. The illness must be shown as downright incapacity or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will. In other words, there is a natal or supervening disabling factor in the person, an adverse integral element in the personality structure that effectively incapacitates the person from really accepting and thereby complying with the obligations essential to marriage.
(6) The essential marital obligations must be those embraced by Articles 68 up to 71 of the Family Code as regards the husband and wife as well as Articles 220, 221 and 225 of the same Code in regard to parents and their children. Such non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the petition, proven by evidence and included in the text of the decision.
(7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, while not controlling or decisive, should be given great respect by our courts x x x.
xxx xxx xxx
(8) The trial court must order the prosecuting attorney or fiscal and the Solicitor General to appear as counsel for the state. No decision shall be handed down unless the Solicitor General issues a certification, which will be quoted in the decision, briefly stating therein his reasons for his agreement or opposition, as the case may be, to the petition. The Solicitor General, along with the prosecuting attorney, shall submit to the court such certification within fifteen (15) days from the date the case is deemed submitted for resolution of the court. The Solicitor General shall discharge the equivalent function of the defensor vinculi contemplated under Canon 1095.
However, with the recent promulgation of Tan-Andal v. Andal 41 (Tan-Andal), We have modified the Molina guidelines to prevent its stringent application in previous nullity cases which is antithetical to the way the concept of psychological incapacity was created.
In Tan-Andal, the husband had a serious drug addiction who constantly failed to overcome his vices and went in and out of a rehabilitation center. His drug addiction was so severe that he even smoked marijuana in the same room where their daughter is. His drug addiction also drove his wife's construction company to bankruptcy as he took the company's money to fund his drug addiction.
The physician-psychiatrist in Tan-Andal diagnosed the husband with narcissistic antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse disorder with psychotic features based on the interviews of the wife, daughter, and sister-in-law of the husband, and the husband's handwritten personal history which the latter made while he was in the rehabilitation center.
In concluding that the husband was psychologically incapacitated, We used the following parameters (Tan-Andal guidelines) in determining what constitutes psychological incapacity:
(1) The psychological incapacity must be shown to have been existing at the time of the celebration of marriage;
(2) Caused by a durable aspect of one's personality structure, one that was formed prior to their marriage;
(3) Caused by a genuinely serious psychic cause; and
(4) Proven by clear and convincing evidence. 42
Moreover, psychological incapacity is now neither a mental incapacity nor a personality disorder that must be proven by expert opinion, viz.:
[T]his Court now categorically abandons the second Molina guideline. Psychological incapacity is neither a mental incapacity nor at personality disorder that must be proven through expert opinion. There must be proof, however, of the durable or enduring aspects of a person's personality, called ""personality structure,"" which manifests itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family. The spouse's personality structure must make it impossible for him or her to understand and, more important, to comply with his or her essential marital obligations.
Proof of these aspects of personality need not be given by an expert. Ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage may testify on behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse. From there, the judge will decide if these behaviors are indicative of a true and serious incapacity to assume the essential marital obligations.
In this way, the Code Committee's intent to limit the incapacity to ""psychic causes"" is fulfilled. Furthermore, there will be no need to label a person as having a mental disorder just to obtain a decree of nullity. A psychologically incapacitated person need not be shamed and pathologized for what could have been a simple mistake in one's choice of intimate partner, a mistake too easy to make as when one sees through rose-colored glasses. A person's psychological incapacity to fulfill his or her marital obligations should not be at the expense of one's dignity, because it could very well be that he or she did not know that the incapacity existed in the first place. 43 (Emphasis ours)
Thus, as categorically declared by the Court, expert testimony or the testimony of a psychologist/psychiatrist is no longer required to prove psychological incapacity. Ordinary witnesses who have been present in the spouses' lives before they contracted marriage may testify on their observations as to the incapacitated spouse's behavior. What is important is that the totality of evidence is sufficient to support a finding of psychological incapacity.
Similarly, juridical antecedence of psychological incapacity may be proven by ordinary witnesses who can describe the incapacitated spouse's past experiences or environment while growing up which may have triggered one's particular behavior. 44 At any rate, the gravity of psychological incapacity must be shown to have been caused by a genuinely serious psychic cause. Thus, ""mild characteriological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts"" are still not accepted grounds that would warrant a finding of psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code. 45
Tan-Andal also modified the requirement on insurability — that psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code must now be incurable, not in the medical, but in the legal sense. 46 As explained, psychological incapacity must be: DETACa
[x x x] so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, and contemplates a situation where the couple's respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage. ""[A]n undeniable pattern of such persisting failure [to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive spouse] must be established so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other."" 47 (Emphasis Ours)
Using the foregoing yardsticks, We reviewed the totality of evidence presented by Maria and found that the same was miserably wanting to sustain the conclusion that Joselito was psychologically incapacitated to perform the basic obligations of marriage.
The personality evaluation report 48 prepared by Dr. Villegas carried a finding that Joselito suffers from a sexual deviant personality disorder or perversion. Notably, this was based solely on Maria's narrations. The psychiatric examination on Maria and interview on her regarding Joselito's family background merely established that the cause of Joselito's personality disorder is likely due to the contrasting parenting behavior of Joselito's father and mother. The relevant portion of her evaluation reads:
On the other hand, Joselito grew up in a family, presenting a strong psychopathology. A cruel father, with whom children are afraid of and a protecting and over solicitous mother, developed confusion in their emotional attachment and identification. It would just be a natural occurrence, that they would lean towards a lesser resistance, developed a faulty role identification, especially in children of the opposite sex. The caring and protecting attitude of the mother, without the balancing effect of the father, gave the children unnatural security and attachments, which became inappropriate in adulthood. Because of faulty identification, he was not able to resolve and became fixated in a sexual stage of development, without reaching a mature genital level. 49
The psychiatrist's description of Joselito's parents' traits does not give this Court a deeper intuitive understanding of Joselito's psychological state. Notably, there was no information how Joselito reacted towards the supposed contrasting personalities of his parents during his formative years. Neither was there any account as to how the said contrasting parenting behavior affected Joselito's social, intellectual, moral, and emotional growth.
Although it had been emphasized in Marcos vs. Marcos 50 and reiterated in Tan-Andal that there is no requirement for one to be personally examined by a physician before he may be declared psychologically incapacitated because what is important is the presence of evidence that adequately establishes the party's psychological incapacity, still, the totality of evidence presented by Maria is lacking to support a finding of psychological incapacity on the part of Joselito.
To emphasize, the testimonies of ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage should include behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse. 51 Here, not only was there no interview or psychological test conducted upon Joselito, there was nobody who testified on vital information regarding his personality structure, upbringing and childhood such as members of his family, relatives, friends, and co-workers. The evaluation of Dr. Villegas on Joselito was based merely on information, accounts and descriptions relayed solely by Maria which glaringly and expectedly are biased.
Applying the amended guidelines in the Tan-Andal case, Maria should have presented witnesses who have been present in their lives before they contracted marriage and who could very well testify on the respondent's behavior. As it stands, the evidence at hand is insufficient to prove juridical antecedence.
We likewise observed that Dr. Villegas merely made a general statement that Joselito's personality disorder is characterized by gravity and incurability. Dr. Villegas utterly failed to expound on the extent or degree of gravity and incurability of Joselito's claimed personality disorder. In any case, it must be stressed that the determination of psychological incapacity is not overly reliant on a psychological report, as long as the totality of evidence presented supports a finding of psychological incapacity. However, apart from the psychological report, there is no other evidence presented to substantiate the allegation of psychological incapacity.
Anent Dr. Villegas' statement that Joselito's preference for oral and anal sex is a grave and serious personality disorder because it affects the sexual function of Joselito and the sexual life of Maria, 52 We hereby reiterate our pronouncement in Molina that ""mere showing of 'irreconcilable differences' and 'conflicting personalities' [as in the present case,] in no wise constitutes psychological incapacity."" 53
In Republic v. Cabantug-Baguio, 54 it was ruled that the failure of the parties to meet their responsibilities and duties as married persons does not amount to psychological incapacity. In this case, the couple's irreconcilable sexual preferences would in no way amount to psychological incapacity. Joselito's inability to sexually satisfy his wife Maria because the latter prefers the conventional way of coitus could not be taken to mean that Joselito is psychologically incapacitated. Sexual incompatibility is not a ground for declaration of nullity of marriage.
With regard to the other grounds relied upon by Maria in support of her petition for the declaration of nullity of her marriage, i.e., sexual infidelity and abandonment, this Court agrees with the CA that said circumstances, assuming that they were true, are grounds for legal separation under Article 55 of the Family Code and not for declaration of nullity of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code.
Article 36 contemplates incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume basic marital obligations and not merely difficulty, refusal, or neglect in the performance of marital obligations or ill will. 55 This incapacity consists of the following: (a) a true inability to commit oneself to the essentials of marriage; (b) this inability to commit oneself must refer to the essential obligations of marriage: the conjugal act, the community of life and love, the rendering of mutual help, the procreation and education of offspring; and (c) the inability must be tantamount to a psychological abnormality. 56
It is worthy to emphasize that Article 36 of the Family Code contemplates downright incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume the basic marital obligations. 57 It is not enough to prove that a spouse failed to meet his responsibilities and duties as a married person; incapacity must be so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage. 58
Irreconcilable differences, conflicting personalities, emotional immaturity and irresponsibility, physical abuse, habitual alcoholism, sexual infidelity or perversion, and abandonment, by themselves, also do not warrant a finding of psychological incapacity under the said Article. 59 It must be stressed that an unsatisfactory marriage is not a null and void marriage. 60
Time and again, it has been held that the State takes a high stake in the preservation of marriage rooted in its recognition of the sanctity of married life and its mission to protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution. 61 Hence, any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and preservation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity. 62 Presumption is always in favor of the validity of marriage. Semper praesumitur pro matrimonio. 63
WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. The August 28, 2006 Decision and November 14, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 80952 sustaining the validity of the marriage of Maria Vicia Carullo-Padua with Joselito Padua are hereby AFFIRMED.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, plaintiff-appellee, vs. RENE MONDEJAR, ARNALDO PARTISALA, FRANCISCO TOLENTINO, ILDEFONSO ESPEJO, MARGARITA GUMAPAS, MANUEL PIOLO, ROBERTO B. VELASCO and HELEN EDITH LEE TAN, accused;
ARNALDO PARTISALA, accused-appellant.
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
Challenged in this appeal 1 is the November 23, 2018 Decision 2 and February 14, 2019 Resolution 3 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. 25674 and 25675, which found accused-appellant Arnaldo Partisala (Partisala) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019, 4 otherwise known as the ""Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act""; and Falsification of Public Document, defined and penalized under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
Procedural Antecedents
Partisala, together with his co-accused, Municipal Mayor Rene Mondejar (Mondejar), Sangguniang Bayan (SB) Secretary Francisco Tolentino (Tolentino), SB Members Ildefonso Espejo (Espejo), Margarita Gumapas (Gumapas), Manuel Piolo (Piolo), Roberto Velasco (Velasco), and President of International Builders Corporation (IBC), Helen Edith Lee Tan (Lee Tan), was charged before the Sandiganbayan with violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 and Falsification of Public Documents under Article 171 of the RPC 5 in two separate Informations which read:
a) Criminal Case No. 25674
That on or about the 27th day of June 1996, and for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Maasin, Province of Iloilo, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, above-named accused, public officers, having been duly elected, appointed and qualified to such public positions above-mentioned, in such capacity and committing the offense in relation to Office, and while in the performance of their official functions, conniving, confederating and mutually helping with each other and with accused HELEN EDITH LEE TAN, a private individual and President/Proprietor of International Builders Corporation, (IBC) Iloilo City with deliberate intent, with manifest partiality and evident bad faith, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously make it appear that Resolution No. 30-B, series of 1996, was validly enacted by the Sangguniang Bayan of Maasin, Iloilo, authorizing Mayor Rene M. Mondejar to exercise his emergency powers as in fact accused RENE M. MONDEJAR, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with accused HELEN EDITH LEE TAN of IBC authorizing the said IBC to engage in massive quarrying in the guise of rechanneling the Tigum River in Maasin, Iloilo, thus accused in the performance of their official functions had given unwarranted benefits, advantage, and preference to Helen Edith Lee Tan and themselves, to the damage and prejudice of the government, particularly the Municipality of Maasin.
CONTRARY TO LAW. 6
b) Criminal Case No. 25675
That on or about the 21st day of June 1996, and for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Maasin, Province of Iloilo, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, above-named accused, public officers, being incumbent Municipal Officials of the aforementioned municipality, having been duly elected, appointed and qualified to such public positions above-mentioned, in such capacity and committing the offense in relation to Office, taking advantage of their official positions, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping one another with deliberate intent to defraud and falsify, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously falsify a Public Document consisting of the Minutes of the Regular Session of the Sangguniang Bayan of Maasin, Iloilo on 21 June 1996, by making it appear therein that the Sangguniang Bayan of Maasin, Iloilo validly enacted and passed Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B entitled ""A Resolution Strongly Endorsing Resolution No. 9 of Barangay NASLO and Resolution No. 9, Series of 1996, of the Municipal Development Council"" and ""A Resolution Authorizing Mayor Rene M. Mondejar to Exercise His Emergency Powers"" thereby making untruthful statements in a narration of facts and causing it to appear that persons participated in an act when they did not in fact so participate, when in truth and in fact, as above-named accused, very well knew, that Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B were never taken up, deliberated nor acted upon by the Sangguniang Bayan of Maasin on its 21 June 1996 regular session.
CONTRARY TO LAW. 7
On September 1, 2003, Partisala failed to appear in his arraignment despite due notice. However, trial ensued as to the other accused. On November 7, 2013, the Sandiganbayan rendered a Decision 8 convicting accused Mondejar, Tolentino, Espejo Gumapas, Piolo, Velasco, and Lee Tan, except Partisala, who remained at large when the judgment was promulgated. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby rules as follows:
1. In Criminal Case No. 25674, the Court finds the accused RENE MONDEJAR, FRANCISCO TOLENTINO, ILDEFONSO ESPEJO, MARGARITA GUMAPAS, MANUEL PIOLO, ROBERTO VELASCO and HELLEN EDITH LEE TAN GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, and sentences each of them to suffer an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum to ten (10) years as maximum; and to suffer perpetual disqualification from public office. Insofar as ARNALDO PARTISALA is concerned, since he is still at large up to the present, let the case be ARCHIVED and let an alias warrant of arrest issue against him.
2. In Criminal Case No. 25675, the Court finds the accused RENE MONDEJAR, FRANCISCO TOLENTINO, ILDEFONSO ESPEJO, MARGARITA GUMAPAS, MANUEL PIOLO and ROBERTO VELASCO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Falsification defined under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code and sentences each of them to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of six (6) months and one (1) day of prision correccional as minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as maximum in the absence of any mitigating and aggravating circumstance in accordance with the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law; to pay a fine of Five Thousand Pesos (Php n perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage. Insofar as ARNALDO PARTISALA is concerned, since he is still at large up to the present, let the case be ARCHIVED and let an alias warrant of arrest issue against him.
SO ORDERED. 9
All the accused, except Partisala, filed their respective motions for reconsideration which were denied by the Sandiganbayan in its June 30, 2015 Resolution. 10 Accused Lee Tan questioned Sandiganbayan's November 7, 2013 Decision and June 30, 2015 Resolution before this Court via a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 with respect to Criminal Case No. 25674. In Our October 17, 2016 Decision in G.R. No. 218902, 11 accused Lee Tan was acquitted for failure of the prosecution to prove the presence of conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt, to wit: CAIHTE
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present Petition is hereby GRANTED. The Sandiganbayan Decision and Resolution dated 7 November 2013 and 30 June 2015, respectively, in Criminal Case No. 25674 insofar as petitioner Tan is concerned are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, petitioner Tan is ACQUITTED from the charge of Violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 3019.
SO ORDERED. 12
Similarly, accused Mondejar filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari 13 under Rule 45 before this Court docketed as G.R. No. 219692. On December 2, 2015, this Court rendered a Resolution 14 affirming with modifications the Sandiganbayan's November 7, 2013 Decision and June 30, 2015 Resolution, viz.:
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Decision and the Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Cases No. 25674 and No. 25675 dated 7 November 2013 and 30 June 2015, respectively, are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. For violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019, petitioner Mayor Rene Mondejar is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum to ten (10) years as maximum and perpetual disqualification from public office. However, the penalty imposed by the Sandiganbayan for violation of Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code is amended to the following modifications that Mayor Mondejar is to suffer an indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months as minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years as maximum penalty, fine of P5,000.00 and perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage.
SO ORDERED. 15
Meanwhile, Partisala was apprehended, 16 and trial against him ensued. The prosecution adopted its Formal Offer of Exhibit dated March 21, 2006, 17 and Supplemental Formal Offer of Exhibits dated July 30, 2012. 18 It likewise adopted and presented the testimonies of Elisa L. Trojillo (Trojillo), Vicente Albacete (Albacete), Imelda Maderada (Maderada), Solidad Sucaldito, Rogelio Rentoy, Darell A. Cabanero, and Rogelio Trinidad as evidence against Partisala. 19
On the other hand, Partisala adopted the Formal Offer of Exhibits of his co-accused Tolentino, Espejo, Gumapas, Piolo, Velasco, Lee Tan, and Mondejar. 20 He likewise admitted that at the time of the incident, he was holding the position of Municipal Vice Mayor of Maasin, Iloilo. 21 He presented Seth Emmanuel Tolentino Casco as additional witness. 22
Factual Antecedents
On June 16, 1996, the Sangguniang Barangay of Naslo, Maasin, Iloilo, enacted Resolution No. 9 requesting IBC to rechannel the path of the Tigum River to protect the barangay from the usual overflow during typhoon season. As payment for its services, IBC was granted the authority to extract surplus sand and gravel supply. 23
On June 17, 1996, the Municipal Development Council (MDC) of Maasin, Iloilo City adopted Resolution No. 9 also requesting: (a) IBC to perform the rechanneling of the Tigum River path; and (b) the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to issue the Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) in connection with the rechanneling project. 24
Consequently, on June 21, 1996, the SB of Maasin, Iloilo enacted: (1) Resolution No. 30-A, which endorsed the resolutions of Barangay Naslo and MDC; 25 and (2) Resolution No. 30-B authorizing Mondejar to use his emergency powers to negotiate with IBC for the rechanneling project. 26
Hence, on June 27, 1996, the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with IBC, through Lee Tan, for the rechanneling project. The parties agreed that IBC would proceed with the project with no monetary consideration provided it would get the surplus supply of sand and gravel taken out from the river after the necessary dike had been constructed. 27
On September 25, 1997, a Letter-Petition was filed with the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo by the residents of Mabini-Rizal, Maasin, Iloilo, airing their grievances for the continued exploitation and destruction of the Tigum River caused by the massive quarrying activities done by IBC in Barangay Naslo, Maasin, Iloilo. 28
October 21, 1997, the Provincial Government of Iloilo issued their Investigation Report finding that the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo violated Sections 3 and 6 (d) of Provincial Ordinance No. 11, series of 1997, by quarrying without the necessary permit from the governor, and by quarrying within a distance of one kilometer from the bridge and other infrastructures. 29 Consequently, the Provincial Government of Iloilo recommended the temporary suspension of the rechanneling project of the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo pending compliance of the provisions of Provincial Ordinance No. 11-95, and other requirements which the governor may impose in the interest of the public. 30
Thereafter, criminal complaints for Falsification under Article 171 of the RPC, and violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, were filed before the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas (OMB-Visayas) against all the accused involved in the rechanneling of the Tigum River path, including Partisala. 31
On May 31, 1999, the OMB-Visayas issued a Resolution recommending the filing of Informations for Falsification under Article 171 of the RPC and violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 against all the accused. 32 On September 16, 1999, the OMB approved the May 31, 1999 Resolution of the OMB-Visayas. 33
In the case of Falsification of Public Documents, Mondejar, Partisala, Tolentino, Espejo, Gumapas, Piolo, and Velasco were criminally charged for making it appear in the Minutes of the Regular Session of the SB of Maasin, Iloilo, held on June 21, 1996, that Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B were deliberated, approved, and/or enacted by the SB on said date. Apparently, no such resolutions were passed and/or enacted. Arguably, the authority given to Mondejar to enter into a MOA with IBC for the rechanneling of Tigum River path was to grant an authority to IBC to engage into massive quarrying activities without the necessary permit. 34
With the foregoing falsification done by the accused, they were also charged with violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 for giving unwarranted benefits and advantage, and displaying manifest partiality, in favor of IBC by entering into a contract grossly disadvantageous to the government, particularly to the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo, which was unduly deprived of the revenues out of the hauling activities of IBC for sand and gravel by reason of such MOA. 35
On his part, Partisala submitted an allegedly original copy of the Minutes of the Regular Session, i.e., Exhibit ""8,"" 36 held by the SB of Maasin, Iloilo on June 21, 1996 under the custody of witness Casco. 37 The said document differed from the Minutes of the Regular Session dated June 21, 1996, i.e., Exhibit ""B,"" 38 submitted by the prosecution as its evidence. Exhibit ""8"" offered by Partisala showed that Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B were deliberated, enacted and/or approved by the SB during the session held on June 21, 1996. 39
On rebuttal, the prosecution presented witness Maderada who pointed out that the Minutes offered by Partisala was falsified as there were insertions of phrases and paragraphs, particularly items 9 to 12, to make it appear that Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B had been enacted by the SB on June 21, 1996. 40
Ruling of the Sandiganbayan
On November 23, 2018, the Sandiganbayan rendered its Decision 41 convicting Partisala of Falsification under Article 171 of the RPC and violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019. The dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, Accused ARNALDO PARTISALA is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act 3019 and for the crime of Falsification defined under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code. Thus, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the following:
1. The indeterminate penalty of imprisonment for six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum and ten (10) years as maximum and to suffer perpetual disqualification from public office for violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019 under Criminal Case No. 25674; and
2. The imprisonment for two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months as minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years as maximum penalty in the absence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, to pay a fine amounting to Five Thousand Pesos (Php5,000), and perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage.
SO ORDERED. 42
In the charge for Falsification, the appellate court gave credence on the Minutes of Regular Session dated June 21, 1996 presented by the prosecution, hereinafter referred as Exhibit ""B,"" and the testimonies of witnesses Trojillo and Albacete to hold Partisala guilty under Article 171 of the RPC. Both witnesses testified that the true and correct Minutes was not signed by Partisala, as then Municipal Vice Mayor of Maasin, Iloilo and presiding officer of the SB. During those times, the members of SB were not used to signing the minutes of the session. Also, the absence of any ill motive on the part of Trojillo and Albacete convinced the appellate court to give full faith and credit on their testimonies and the authenticity of Exhibit ""B."" Partisala failed to timely object on the admissibility of Exhibit ""B."" 43
The anti-graft court was not persuaded by Partisala's own presentation of the Minutes of Regular Session dated June 21, 1996, hereinafter referred as Exhibit ""8,"" showing that the SB deliberated, enacted, and/or approved Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B. Defense witness Casco merely certified that he had the custody and possession of Exhibit ""8"" as then incumbent Secretary of the SB, but was not in any way connected nor part thereof during the enactment of the subject Resolutions. In addition, the rebuttal of witness Maderada is credible. She declared that Exhibit ""8"" was a falsified document by pointing out the presence of members Espino and Espejo in the original session as per Exhibit ""B,"" but Espino was declared absent in the session as per Exhibit ""8,"" as he was already deceased during the execution of the said falsified minutes. 44
In the case of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, the Sandiganbayan found evident bad faith on the part of Partisala when he participated in the falsification of the subject Resolutions granting Mondejar emergency powers to enter into a MOA with IBC. Without such deliberate falsification, IBC would not have any authority to haul any and all excess sand and gravel from Tigum River. The act of falsifying the subject resolutions affirmatively perpetrated their furtive design to quarry sand and gravel from Tigum River for self-interest and ulterior purpose. 45
Lastly, the anti-graft found that with the enactment of the subject Resolutions, IBC was given unwarranted benefits without the necessary permit, which must be obtained from the Provincial Government of Iloilo. Although IBC already have a quarrying permit issued by the provincial government, its consequent MOA with the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo had given it the liberty to engage in quarrying activities beyond the scope granted to it by the provincial government under the guise of performing service to the people through the construction of a dike and rechanneling of Tigum River. 46
Issues
The issues raised for consideration of this Court are:
1. Whether or not, the act of SB Members, including herein accused Partisala, in authorizing then Mayor Rene Mondejar to enter in the Memorandum of Agreement has given unwarranted benefit and/or advantage to Helen Edith Lee Tan in violation of R.A. No. 3019.
2. Whether or not accused Partisala, with his co-accused public officers conspired with each other in falsifying the Minutes of the Regular Session of the SB of Maasin, Iloilo. 47
Our Ruling
After due consideration, We resolve to sustain Partisala's conviction of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 and Falsification of Public Documents under Article 171 of the RPC. DETACa
Falsification of Public Documents
Partisala contends that the prosecution failed to prove or present evidence of the deliberations of Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B. He insists that Exhibit ""8"" was certified and identified by witness Casco, the legal custodian. The minutes he offered as evidence, i.e., Exhibit ""8"" was recorded in the journal, i.e., Exhibit ""37"" as testified to by Tolentino. Both Exhibit ""8"" and Exhibit ""37"" are the same on material points. 48
He adds that to prove Falsification of Public Documents, the prosecution must present the true or real copy of the minutes, which they failed to do. Exhibit ""B"" offered in evidence by the prosecution was the draft minutes provided to all sanggunian members, which may or may not include all matters deliberated upon. To duly prove his guilt under paragraph 2, Article 171 of the RPC, that is, ""that he falsifies a document by causing it to appear that a person or persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not so participate,"" the prosecution must produce the alleged original copy of the minutes claimed to have been falsified. 49
However, in the case at bar, Partisala argues that there is a dispute as to which document, i.e., between Exhibit ""B"" or Exhibit ""8,"" is authentic or original. The prosecution's alleged copy of the minutes, i.e., Exhibit ""B"" is a personal copy of Ernie Malaga who was not presented to identify the same, in contrast to the defense's Exhibit ""8,"" which was certified and identified by the SB Secretary at that time, witness Casco. 50
We are not persuaded.
In Falsification of Public Documents under paragraph 2, Article 171 of the RPC, the prosecution must prove the existence of the following elements: (1) that the offender is a public officer, employee, or notary public; (2) that he takes advantage of his official position; (3) that he falsifies a document by causing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding; and (4) that such persons did not in fact so participate in the proceeding. 51
Admittedly, Partisala was a public officer, being the Vice-Mayor of Maasin, Iloilo City, at the time material to the case. He took advantage of his official position as the vice mayor, together with his co-accused, to falsify the Minutes of the SB on the session held on June 21, 1996 by making or preparing or intervening in the preparation thereof, to make it appear that the SB deliberated on the issuance of Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B giving Mondejar the authority to enter into a contract with IBC with respect to the rechanneling of Tigum River.
Contrary to Exhibit ""8,"" SB Members Trojillo and Albacete testified that they did not deliberate on the issuance of Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B. In fact, Trojillo declared that Partisala himself asked him to sign a document ""Minutes of the Regular Session of the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo, held in the Municipal Session hall on June 21, 1996 in the afternoon."" 52 She merely signed the document without reading its full contents on the presumption that it was reflective of the session held on June 21, 1996 and a true copy of the minutes. 53 However, she discovered that Exhibit ""8"" contained insertions which were not deliberated upon by the SB. 54 Hence, she readily executed an Affidavit of Retraction dated December 19, 1997 55 to contest her signature on the said Minutes.
Albacete corroborated the testimony of Trojillo when he declared that Exhibit ""8"" presented by Partisala contained items which were not discussed nor deliberated upon by the SB, specifically Item Nos. 9 to 12. 56 Upon knowledge thereof, he executed an Affidavit dated April 29, 1998 57 regarding the absence of deliberation on rechanneling of Tigum River on the regular session dated June 21, 1996. He affirmed that he could not recall Item No.11 in Exhibit ""8,"" that is, Resolution No. 9, which was a resolution requesting for the rechanneling of Tigum River by the MDC, being taken up during the subject session. 58
Contrary to Partisala's contention, there is no need to present the alleged true copy of the Minutes of the session held on June 21, 1996, i.e., Exhibit ""B,"" nor it be identified by Malaga in order for him to be held liable for Falsification of Public Documents. It is undisputed, and in fact admitted by Partisala himself, that he took part in executing Exhibit ""8"" and even signed it. However, as per the testimonies of the SB members Trojillo and Albacete, Exhibit ""8"" contained items which were not discussed during the session held on June 21, 1996, thereby causing them to participate in a session which approved the assailed Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B wherein fact they did not participate.
Even without the prosecution presenting Malaga to identify Exhibit ""B,"" all the elements of Falsification of Public document are duly established in the case at bar. Besides, SB Members Trojillo and Albacete, who were present during the June 21, 1996 session, confirmed the absence of deliberations on the enactment of Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B as reflected in Exhibit ""B."" Even Resolution No. 30, which pertains to the appropriation of funds for the construction of farm to market roads in certain barangays to generate maximum farm production, is not in any way related to the sub-resolutions, namely, Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B, which concern the rechanneling of Tigum River. Another Resolution enacted by the SB on the same day, June 21, 1996, that is, Resolution No. 31, refers to the approval of re-alignment of the 20% IRA Development Fund allotted for the improvement of the public market. 59 Plainly, Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B were merely inserted in the minutes of the session held on June 21, 1996, as there is no logical reason for its inclusion under the heading of Resolution No. 30, which had no connection with the subject matter of Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B. The SB should have enacted another resolution separate from Resolution No. 30 if the SB indeed enacted such assailed resolutions on the same day, June 21, 1996.
Also, it bears noting that Resolution No. 30 recommended the approval of Resolution No. 10, series of 1996 issued by the MDC, while Resolution No. 30-A recommended the approval of Resolution No. 9, series of 1996 issued by the MDC. Patently, Resolution No. 30 and Resolution No. 30-A referred to different issues and/or subjects as contained in the resolutions issued by the MDC. It is also worth pointing out that Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B were allegedly taken from the excerpts of the Minutes of Regular Session on June 21, 1996 at 1:30 p.m., or thirty minutes ahead of Resolution No. 30, which was taken up at 2:00 p.m. on June 21, 1996. If indeed the SB had taken up and deliberated the matter of rechanneling of Tigum River ahead of construction of farm to market roads, then there is no wisdom in issuing another ""Resolution No. 30"" when ""Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B"" were already enacted, especially when these three resolutions were not at all related. Evidently, Partisala and his co-accused concealed their (Resolution Nos. 30-A and 30-B) insertion in the minutes of June 21, 1996 by having it signed by other members of the SB who were unaware that they were signing a falsified public document, which contained matters not deliberated upon in the session held on June 21, 1996.
Falsification of Public Document is committed when the public document is simulated ""in a manner so as to give it the appearance of a true and genuine instrument, thus, leading others to errors as to its authenticity."" 60 The refusal of Trojillo and Albacete to sign the falsified minutes prepared by Tolentino after June 21, 1996 to legitimize the MOA entered into by Mondejar, sufficiently proved that the minutes did not reflect the true and actual proceedings of the session held on June 21, 1996. Clearly, Partisala's participation in the falsification of the minutes cannot be denied, as he himself persuaded Trojillo to sign it to make it appear that there are two resolutions justifying the MOA entered into by Mondejar with IBC. 61
As a rule, the Court considers as conclusive the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan unless they fall under certain exceptions, which is not present in the case at bar. 62 The Court accords great respect and weight to the Sandiganbayan's findings as it had the better opportunity to examine and evaluate the evidence presented before it. 63 Hence, We find no error in the assailed Decision of the Sandiganbayan finding Partisala guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Falsification of Public Documents under Article 171 of the RPC.
Nonetheless, We deem it proper to correct the penalty imposed by the Sandiganbayan, which is imprisonment of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years, as maximum. In applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISLAW) for offenses punishable under the RPC or special laws, the indeterminate sentence should have a fixed minimum and maximum term of imprisonment, 64 and not a range as imposed in this case by the Sandiganbayan.
Article 171 of the RPC imposed the penalty of prision mayor and a fine not to exceed P5,000.00. Under ISLAW, the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence shall be taken from the maximum period of the prescribed penalty, after considering the modifying circumstances in the commission of the crime. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances in this case, the maximum term should be within the medium period of the prescribed penalty, that is, eight (8) years and one (1) day, to (10) ten years, of prision mayor. On the other hand, the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence shall be within the range of the penalty next lower in degree to that provided by law, that is, prision correccional, or within six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years.
Applying the foregoing, We hereby impose on Partisala the penalty of imprisonment of two (2) years of prision correccional, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum; and a fine of P5,000.00.
Violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019
To reiterate, Partisala averred that Exhibit ""8"" is the certified true copy of the minutes of the session held on June 21, 1996 which deliberated upon the enactment of Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B. Hence, he argues that Resolution No. 30-B, authorizing Mondejar to negotiate with IBC regarding the rechanneling project was validly enacted, and that he did not give any form of benefit or advantage to anyone.
We are not convinced.
In Ampil v. Office of the Ombudsman, 65 the Court specified the following elements of the offense falling under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019:
(1) The offender is a public officer;
(2) The act was done in the discharge of the public officer's official, administrative judicial functions;
(3) The act was done through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and
(4) The public officer caused any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference. 66
To restate, Partisala is the Vice Mayor of Maasin, Iloilo at the time material to the offense charged. A perusal of the records reveal that he deliberately acted with manifest partiality and bad faith when he, as the presiding officer of the SB, signed Exhibit ""8"" and persuaded the other sangguniang members to sign it, knowing fully well that there were certain items not included nor discussed on the regular session held on June 21, 1996, specifically the enactment of Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B. aDSIHc
As a result thereof, Mondejar was given the authority to enter into a MOA with IBC with respect to the rechanneling of Tigum River, which was grossly disadvantageous to the government. IBC was given unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference by virtue of the MOA to rechannel the Tigum River, not in the form of monetary compensation, but by getting the surplus supply of sand and gravel extracted from the river, despite not having the necessary permit to do so. As per Section 138 of the Local Government Code, the permit to extract sand, gravel, and other quarry resources shall be issued exclusively by the provincial governor, by virtue of an ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan. With the enactment of Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B, which paved the way for the execution of the MOA, the SB of Maasin, Iloilo clearly acted without authority, and caused undue injury to the government, when it authorized IBC to extract sand and gravel from Tigum River. As per the Investigation Report dated October 21, 1997, 67 and Final Investigation dated November 18, 1997 issued by the Provincial Legal Office, 68 IBC was able to extract sand and gravel without any permit from the provincial ""over government and/or payment of any tax, on the pretext that it was doing a rechanneling project for the benefit of the municipality as per the MOA. Clearly, the execution of the MOA contemplates unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference given to IBC, which is proscribed by RA 3019. The said benefit, advantage, or preference would not have been probable without the participation of Partisala, as the presiding officer of the SB of Maasin, Iloilo, in enacting Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B, through falsification of the minutes of the regular session dated June 21, 1996.
As to the penalty imposed, the Sandiganbayan correctly meted the penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum; and perpetual disqualification from public office.
WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The November 23, 2018 Decision and February 14, 2019 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. 25674 and 25675, are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as to the penalty imposed on accused-appellant Arnaldo Partisala for Falsification of Public Document, defined and penalized under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code. He is hereby sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of two (2) years of prision correccional, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as maximum, and to pay a fine of P5,000.00.

SYSTEMS AND PLAN INTEGRATOR AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND/OR ENGR. JULIETA CUNANAN, petitioners, vs. MICHELLE ELVI C. BALLESTEROS, respondent.
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
This Petition for Review 1 under Rule 45 seeks the reversal of the June 26, 2014 Decision 2 and February 5, 2015 Resolution 3 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 130935, which affirmed with modification the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) January 10, 2013 Decision, 4 declaring respondent Michelle Elvi C. Ballesteros (Ballesteros) illegally dismissed by petitioner Systems and Plan Integrator and Development Corp. (SPID Corp.), and/or Engr. Julieta 5 Cunanan (Cunanan).
The Facts
The facts of the case, as lifted from the Labor Arbiter (LA) Decision, 6 are as follows:
Ballesteros started working for SPID Corp. on June 15, 2005 as a Customer Service Representative. She was eventually promoted to administrative staff with a basic salary of P9,900.00, Emergency Cost of Living Allowance (ECOLA) of P2,200.00, and transportation allowance of P1,000.00, totaling to P14,300.00. 7
During the first week of February 2011, Kristine Castro (Castro), Personnel Officer of SPID Corp., talked to Ballesteros and told her that Cunanan, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SPID Corp., was asking for her resignation because she was pregnant, and was going to have two children to take care of. Castro even told Ballesteros that she was going to be terminated anyway so resignation would be a better option. 8
Disturbed by this imposition, Ballesteros talked to Ronniel Cunanan (Cunanan), SPID Corp.'s Administration and Finance Officer, who confirmed that the company is indeed asking Ballesteros to tender her resignation, saying that although she did not have a bad record that would justify her termination, the company decided to terminate her for the same reasons given above. 9
On March 25, 2011, Ballesteros gave birth and availed of the maternity leave. Sometime in April 2011, she went back to the office and told Castro that she did not want to resign. The following week, she returned and reiterated to Castro her decision not to resign. Castro offered Ballesteros two options: first, she resigns and the company will issue her a clear Certificate of Employment; or second, the company terminates her employment, and gives her salary for one month, and her 13th month pay. When Ballesteros asked again for the reason for her termination, Castro replied that she had received memoranda from the company, one each during the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, which Ballesteros vehemently protested to, as her superiors have always told her that she did not have a bad record during the five and a half years she was employed by the company. Castro told her that she would still be terminated, and she should wait for her impending termination notice. 10
On May 31, 2011, while still on maternity leave, Ballesteros discovered that her salary for the period of May 15 to 31, 2011 was not deposited to her account even if her maternity leave was until June 21, 2011. Alarmed, she contacted Castro and found out that the company withheld her salary and would only be released if Ballesteros would process her SSS maternity benefits and tender her resignation letter. Still, Ballesteros refused to resign. 11
On June 5, 2011, Ballesteros received a letter 12 from the company informing her of her termination from the service. cSaATC
On the other hand, the company alleged that Ballesteros' employment was terminated based on her incompetence and inefficiency in the performance of duties. Also, SPID Corp. lost its confidence and trust in Ballesteros because of her continued neglect of duty and habitual absences and tardiness. 13 The company enumerated the following instances showing Ballesteros' incompetence and inefficiency:
(a) On July 7, 2008, Ballesteros was issued a memorandum 14 for habitual absences and for neglect of duty which adversely affected her work and for which she was sternly reminded that continued violation may result in suspension or termination;
(b) On February 11, 2009, Ballesteros was again admonished for not following company procedure in the preparation of deposit slips; 15
(c) Her continued neglect of duty as a Customer Service Representative constrained the company to re-assign her to the Accounting Department;
(d) On September 24, 2010, Ballesteros was reprimanded for incurring a cash shortage due to her admitted lapses;
(e) There were other instances that Ballesteros incurred cash shortages; and
(f) On February 21, 2011, the company issued a memorandum 16 to Ballesteros requiring her to explain in writing why she should not be terminated from employment, enumerating therein her violations. 17
SPID Corp. alleged that Ballesteros refused to receive the February 21, 2011 memorandum, but instead requested to talk with Cunanan to plea for leniency considering her impending delivery. The memorandum was not a notice of termination, but a notice to explain in writing why Ballesteros should not be terminated.
SPID Corp. further alleged that Ballesteros offered to resign after she gives birth as a graceful exit from the company, and requested to be given a certificate of employment to find a new job. This offer was accepted by Cunanan, subject to the condition that Ballesteros submits a formal response to the memorandum to explain. However, Ballesteros failed to submit the explanation within the given period, thus, was deemed to have waived her right to due process. 18
Thus, on January 16, 2012, Ballesteros filed a Complaint 19 for illegal dismissal, non-payment of wages, service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay, damages, and attorney's fees.
Ruling of the Labor Arbiter
In a Decision 20 dated June 5, 2012, the arbiter dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, ruling as follows:
After a perusal of the evidence on hand, we rule that the version of the respondents deserves more credence than that of complainant. This can be gleaned from the various print-outs generated from the respondent company's biometric-based attendance system where it is shown that in 2010, complainant incurred 203 counts of tardiness/undertime and 4 counts of absences without leave, while in 2011, she incurred 52 counts of tardiness and 7 counts of absences without pay.
While complainant claims that the print-outs are self-serving with no probative value, we are convinced that the biometric-based system of recording employee attendance is tamper-proof and conclusive evidence of an employee's attendance record[s] since the entries therein are based on the employee's biometrics or finger print.
xxx xxx xxx
However, while we find complainant's dismissal to be attended by just cause, there is no evidence on record showing that complainant was duly informed of the charges levelled against her and given the opportunity to answer the same. The claim of the respondents that complainant refused to receive the memorandum of February 21, 2011, thereby waiving her right to be heard will not suffice. What the respondents should have done was to send x x x the said memorandum by registered mail to complainant's last known address.
Given the foregoing circumstances, the lack of procedural due process should not nullify complainant's dismissal. The respondent company should, however, indemnify complainant for violating her statutory rights. Nominal damages in the sum of P20,000.00 is in order.
xxx xxx xxx
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the complaint for illegal dismissal is hereby dismissed for lack of merit. However, the respondent company is hereby ordered to pay the complainant as follows:
1. P20,000.00 by way of nominal damages; and
2. P4,950.00 as proportionate 13th month pay for the year 2011.
All other claims are hereby dismissed for lack of basis.
SO ORDERED. 21
Ruling of the National Labor
Relations Commission
On appeal, the NLRC reversed the LA's ruling. The dispositive portion of the NLRC Decision reads thus: cHDAIS
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision is set aside and a new one is hereby entered declaring the dismissal of the complainant illegal. As a consequence, respondent Systems and Plan Integrator and Development Corporation is ordered to reinstate complainant Michelle Elvi C. Ballesteros to her former position without the loss of seniority rights and to pay her backwages and other benefits, thus:
a) P233,730.48 representing backwages as of the date of this decision until she is actually reinstated in the service;
b) P25,000.00 representing moral damages and another P25,000.00 representing exemplary damages;
c) P20,000.00 representing nominal damages [as previously awarded by the Labor Arbiter];
d) P4,950.00 representing proportionate 13th month pay for 2011 [as previously awarded by the Labor Arbiter] and;
e) 10% of the recoverable amount representing attorney's fees.
SO ORDERED. 22
SPID Corp.'s motion for reconsideration was denied in a Resolution 23 dated May 17, 2013.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals
The June 26, 2014 Decision 24 of the CA dismissed the company's case for lack of merit. The following are the relevant portions of the Decision as well as the dispositive portion:
Based on the foregoing, the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it ruled that habitual leave of absences (gross habitual neglect of duty) in 2008; open and willful disobedience in 2009; and monetary shortage in 2010, resulting in the respondent company's loss of trust and confidence, were never substantiated. In the absence of substantial evidence, the contentions of petitioners are self-serving and incapable of showing that the dismissal of the private respondent was justified.
xxx xxx xxx
[As to the requirement of procedural due process], We disagree with the finding of both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC that there is no evidence on record showing that the private respondent was duly informed of the charges leveled against her and that she was given the opportunity to answer the same.
xxx xxx xxx
We are convinced that the notice to explain (February 21, 2011 memorandum) was validly served upon the private respondent. Kristine Castro, Personnel Officer of petitioner SPIDC, indicated on the said notice that the private respondent ""refused to receive because she wanted to talk to Mr. Ronniel Cunanan."" Castro also executed an Affidavit dated April 24, 2012 attesting that she personally served the February 21, 2011 memorandum to the private respondent but the latter refused to receive it, but she (private respondent) got a copy anyway. The handwritten notation and Castro's affidavit are substantial pieces of evidence proving that the notice to explain was validly served upon the private respondent.
Accordingly, the requirement of procedural due process, particularly, the two-notice rule, was observed. Hence, there is no basis to award nominal damages in the amount of P20,000.00.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit. The assailed decision dated January 10, 2013 is AFFIRMED with modification that the award of nominal damages is deleted.
SO ORDERED. 25 (Emphasis supplied)
Thus, this Petition for Review on Certiorari which seeks to reverse and set aside the CA Decision, and for the termination from employment of Ballesteros to be declared legal.
Issue
The company raises the issue of whether or not Ballesteros was validly terminated from employment.
Our Ruling
The petition is unmeritorious.
At the outset, this Court emphasizes that the instant petition's issue directly pertains to the legality of Ballesteros' dismissal which, by the nature of the arguments of the parties, involves a calibration and re-evaluation of the evidence they presented, as well as a review of the factual findings of the LA, NLRC, and the CA. As a rule, the Court does not review questions of fact, but only questions of law in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, because this Court is not a trier of facts. It will not review the factual findings of the lower tribunals as these are generally binding and conclusive. 26 The exception is when the findings of the CA and the labor tribunals are contradictory. 27
In this case, considering that the findings and rulings of the NLRC and the CA, on one hand, and those of the LA, on the other, are conflicting, the Court finds sufficient basis for a review of the factual matters in this case in conjunction with the questions of law involved. ISHCcT
Substantial Due Process: Just
causes for a valid dismissal from
employment
For a dismissal from employment to be valid, it must be pursuant to either a just, or an authorized cause, under Articles 297, 28 298, 29 or 299 30 of the Labor Code, as amended. 31 Furthermore, the burden of proving that the termination of an employee was for a just or authorized cause lies with the employer. If the employer fails to meet this burden, the dismissal is unjustified, thus, illegal. 32 To discharge this burden, the employer must present substantial evidence, or the amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion, and not based on mere surmises or conjectures. 33
Here, the company dismissed Ballesteros based on three just causes: (a) habitual leaves of absence or gross habitual neglect of duty; (b) open and willful disobedience; and (c) money shortage, thus, loss of trust and confidence. 34
Gross and Habitual Neglect of
Duty
SPID Corp. dismissed Ballesteros based on gross neglect of duty because of her habitual leaves of absence, habitual tardiness, and undertime.
As to her habitual leaves of absence, the CA ruled that the company failed to present substantial evidence to prove that Ballesteros, indeed, was habitually absent, thus, neglected her duty. The CA found that Ballesteros only incurred 1.5 vacation leaves and 11 sick leaves from January 2008 to July 7, 2008, the period covered by the notice of termination, which were also deducted from her earned leave credits. 35
The Court agrees with the CA. Robustan, Inc. v. Court of Appeals 36 provides the standard for establishing gross neglect of duty as a just cause for terminating employment:
Thus, under the Labor Code, to be a valid ground for dismissal, the negligence must be gross and habitual. Gross negligence has been defined as the want or absence of even slight care or diligence as to amount to a reckless disregard of the safety of the person or property. It evinces a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them. Put differently, gross negligence is characterized by want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently, but willfully and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected. 37
The presentation of the certified true copies of Ballesteros' leave ledger does not sufficiently establish the required habituality of neglect that would merit her dismissal. For one, all the leaves she incurred were deducted from earned leave credits, meaning, credits she was entitled to over the course of her work. 38 This Court has held that only habitual absenteeism without leave constitutes gross negligence. 39 Secondly, such leaves were so few to be characterized as a reckless disregard for the safety of the company. It could not be said that she repeatedly neglected her duty for she was only absent for a total of 12.5 days over the period of six months and a week (January 2008 to July 7, 2008).
As to her habitual tardiness and undertime for the years of 2010 and 2011, the CA found that the company only charged Ballesteros in her notice of termination with habitual leaves of absence from January 2008 to July 7, 2008, not for the years 2010 and 2011. 40
The rudimentary requirements of due process require that an employer dismissing an employee must furnish the latter with two written notices before the termination of employment can be effected: (1) the first notice apprises the employee of the particular acts or omissions for which the dismissal is sought; and (2) the second notice informs the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him or her. 41 Case law has not been strict with this two-notice rule, however. Failure to observe or to prove compliance of the same would still make the dismissal valid, as long as a just or authorized cause for dismissal exists, with the employer, however, being held liable for nominal damages. 42
A perusal of the records of the case would show that the first notice, which is the ""Notice to Explain Why [Ballesteros] Should Not be Terminated"" 43 dated February 21, 2011, enumerated as Ballesteros' fourth offense ""Habitual tardiness and undertime for more than one hour and more than ten days in a month for the last 6 months resulting to gross neglect of duty."" 44 However, the second notice, which is the Notice of Termination 45 dated June 3, 2011, showed that the company failed to include the habitual tardiness and undertime of Ballesteros from 2010 to 2011.
Habitual tardiness alone is a just cause for termination. 46 Punctuality is a reasonable standard imposed on every employee, whether in government or private sector, whereas habitual tardiness is a serious offense that may very well constitute gross or habitual neglect of duty, a just cause to dismiss a regular employee. 47 Habitual tardiness manifests lack of initiative, diligence and discipline that are inimical to the employer's general productivity and business interest. 48
Here, the Court finds that although habitual tardiness is a just cause for termination, the company failed again to substantiate Ballesteros' habitual tardiness and undertime, as the generated print-outs presented to the NLRC were mere photocopies and unauthenticated. 49 The Court had previously disregarded unsigned listings and computer printouts presented in evidence by the employer to prove its employee's absenteeism and tardiness, holding thus: CAacTH
In the case at bar, there is paucity of evidence to establish the charges of absenteeism and tardiness. We note that the employer company submitted mere handwritten listing and computer print-outs. The handwritten listing was not signed by the one who made the same. As regards the print-outs, while the listing was computer generated, the entries of time and other annotations were again handwritten and unsigned.
We find that the handwritten listing and unsigned computer print-outs were unauthenticated and, hence, unreliable. Mere self-serving evidence of which the listing and print-outs are of that nature should be rejected as evidence without any rational probative value even in administrative proceedings. 50 (Emphasis supplied)
Similarly, absent reliable and reasonable proof that Ballesteros was indeed habitually tardy, and habitually incurred undertime for more than 10 days in a month for six months, the Court cannot conclude that she is guilty of gross and habitual neglect of duty.
Open and Willful Disobedience
SPID Corp. argues that Ballesteros' dismissal was due to her open and willful disobedience of company procedure in the preparation of deposit slips.
For willful disobedience to be a valid cause for dismissal, these two elements must concur: (1) the employee's assailed conduct must have been willful or intentional, the willfulness being characterized by ""a wrongful and perverse attitude""; and (2) the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee, and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge. 51
Again, the CA held that no substantial evidence would show that Ballesteros willfully violated the verbal instructions. There is lack of substantial evidence that would show that the company gave clear verbal instructions regarding the preparation of deposit slips. 52
The Court agrees. The records show no proof that the company made known to Ballesteros instructions on preparation of deposit slips, except the February 11, 2009 Memorandum 53 reprimanding her for her negligence. Neither did the company present proof that Ballesteros' transgression was coupled with a wrongful intent, or a wrongful and perverse attitude, both very different from mere simple negligence, or a mere error in judgment. Again, the burden is on the employer to present substantial evidence, or the amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. 54
Even if the company presented proof of both the instruction, and Ballesteros' violation of the instruction, her failure ""to text the [concerned] employee [regarding] their deposit slips while waiting for the scanner to be fixed"" 55 cannot be said to be a product of a wrongful and perverse attitude. It was merely a momentary lapse of judgment on her part, rather than some design to circumvent the company's policy regarding deposit slips. The requirement of willfulness or wrongful intent in the appreciation of the aforementioned just causes, in turn, underscores the intent of the law to reserve only to the gravest infractions the ultimate penalty of dismissal. It is essential that the infraction committed by an employee is serious, not merely trivial, and be reflective of a certain degree of depravity or ineptitude on the employee's part, in order for the same to be a valid basis for the termination of his employment. 56
Loss of Trust and Confidence
The last ground for Ballesteros' dismissal is loss of trust and confidence due to a monetary shortage amounting to P1,100.00.
Loss of trust and confidence may be a just case for termination of employment only upon proof that: (1) the dismissed employee occupied a position of trust and confidence; and (2) the dismissed employee committed ""an act justifying the loss of trust and confidence."" 57
The first element was met because Ballesteros, an administrative officer at the time of her termination, held a position of trust and confidence. Her tasks included ""answering/endorsement of telephone calls, preparation of deposit slips, handling of petty cash fund, front-lining duties, and other related tasks."" 58 However, the second element, pertaining to the act that breached the company's trust and confidence, was never established in the NLRC and CA proceedings. For loss of trust and confidence to be a valid ground for dismissal, it must be substantial, and not arbitrary, whimsical, capricious, and concocted. It demands that a degree of severity attends the employee's breach of trust. 59
The Court agrees with the CA that Ballesteros' monetary shortage in the amount of P1,100.00 cannot be considered substantial and severe, as to justify the company's loss of trust and confidence in her. Furthermore, not only did Ballesteros admit that she was negligent in not counting the money before returning the same, the amount was even deducted from her salary and returned to the company. 60 To dismiss Ballesteros over such an insignificant amount which she duly returned would amount to a clear injustice.
Procedural Due Process
Finally, the Court agrees with the CA that the company exercised procedural due process in accordance with Philippine labor laws which was elaborated in the case of Dela Rosa v. ABS-CBN Corporation, 61 as follows:
As a rule, the employer is required to furnish the employee with two (2) written notices before termination of employment can be effected: a first written notice that informs the employee of the particular acts or omissions for which his or her dismissal is sought, and a second written notice which informs the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him. Anent the second notice, the written notice of termination should indicate that: (a) all circumstances involving the charge against the employees have been considered; and (b) grounds have been established to justify the severance of their employment. 62
In this case, the Court agrees with the CA that two notices were validly served upon Ballesteros, despite the fact that she refused to receive the first notice ""because she wanted to talk to Mr. Ronniel Cunanan."" 63 The CA correctly found and held that: IAETDc
[T]he notice to explain (February 21, 2011 memorandum) was validly served upon the [Ballesteros]. Kristine Castro, Personnel Officer of [the company], indicated on the said notice that the private respondent ""refused to receive because she wanted to talk to Mr. Ronniel Cunanan."" Castro also executed an Affidavit dated April 24, 2012 attesting that she personally served the February 21, 2011 memorandum to [Ballesteros] but the latter refused to receive it, but she x x x got a copy anyway. The handwritten notation and Castro's affidavit are substantial pieces of evidence proving that the notice to explain was validly served upon [Ballesteros].
Accordingly, the requirement of procedural due process, particularly, the two-notice rule, was observed. Hence, there is no basis to award nominal damage in the amount of P20,000.00. 64
WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review is hereby DENIED. The June 26, 2014 Decision and February 5, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 130935, which affirmed with modification the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) January 10, 2013 Decision declaring respondent Michelle Elvi C. Ballesteros (Ballesteros) illegally dismissed, are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Systems and Plan Integrator and Development Corporation is ordered to REINSTATE respondent Michelle Elvi C. Ballesteros to her former or equivalent position without the loss of seniority rights, and to PAY her backwages and other benefits reckoned from the time her salaries were withheld.

[G.R. No. 215175. April 25, 2022.]
ALJEM'S CREDIT INVESTORS CORPORATION, petitioner, vs. SPOUSES CATALINA AND PORFERIO BAUTISTA, respondents.
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
This Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 assails the September 25, 2013 Decision 2 and October 9, 2014 Resolution 3 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 02287-MIN, which affirmed the July 11, 2007 Order 4 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 10, Davao City, that denied the Motion for Summary Judgment 5 filed by petitioner Aljem's Credit Investors Corporation, in a civil action it initiated against respondent-spouses Catalina and Porferio Bautista (spouses Bautista).
The Factual Antecedents:
This case is an offshoot of an action 6 for accion publiciana, rescission of contract to sell, with damages and attorney's fees, filed by petitioner against the spouses Bautista.
Petitioner alleged that a parcel of land owned by the spouses Bautista was mortgaged to it as security for a loan. 7 The Bautistas failed to pay the loan; thus, petitioner foreclosed the mortgage. 8 As the spouses Bautista did not redeem the property within the reglementary period, title to the property was consolidated in petitioner's name. 9
When petitioner was about to take possession of the property, Catalina Bautista (Catalina), the wife, offered to repurchase the property. 10 Petitioner accepted the offer, so they entered into a Contract to Sell on August 29, 2000. 11 The Spouses Bautista, however, failed to comply with the Contract to Sell resulting to its cancellation. 12 The parties entered into another Contract to Sell on September 27, 2001; however, despite several demands to pay or vacate the property, the spouses Bautista still failed to comply even with a new contract. 13
Thus, petitioner sent demand letters to Catalina to vacate the property. 14 The last demand letter to vacate was sent on January 18, 2006. 15 All demands were to no avail, resulting to petitioner's filing of the complaint. 16
The spouses Bautista alleged that the mortgage contract is void as it did not bear the conformity of Porferio Bautista (Porferio), the husband. 17 They also contended that the contract to sell contains a provision on pactum commissorium, which is illegal, and that the contract should be considered as an equitable mortgage. 18 They likewise contested the high interest rates imposed. 19
Petitioner filed its Reply. 20
Subsequently, petitioner filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, 21 alleging that there is no genuine issue of fact because: (a) the spouses Bautista admitted that the Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) of the property is in petitioner's name; (b) there were no specific denials of the material allegations of the complaint; (c) the defense of the spouses Bautista are legal issues, not factual; and, (d) there is no genuine issue of fact. 22
The spouses Bautista opposed the motion contending that a full-blown trial is necessary to determine: (a) whether there is an equitable mortgage; (b) the propriety of the imposition of the interest rates; (c) presence of pactum commissorium; and, (d) whether Porferio's signature was forged. 23 CAIHTE
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:
In its July 11, 2007 Order, 24 the RTC denied petitioner's Motion for Summary Judgment. It held that there are genuine issues of facts that should be threshed out in a full-blown trial, such as whether: (a) the contract to sell is an equitable mortgage; (b) the contract to sell is in the nature of pactum commissorium; (c) the imposition of interest is proper; and (d) the signature of Porferio was forged. 25
Aggrieved, petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition 26 before the CA.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
In its September 25, 2013 Decision, 27 the CA affirmed the RTC. It held that the defenses raised by the spouses Bautista are triable issues. One of the defenses raised is the invalidity of the mortgage due to the lack of Porferio's conformity. Pursuant to the Family Code, a disposition of a property without the consent of the other spouse is void. Petitioner's right of ownership on the subject property is linked to the mortgage; if the mortgage is invalid due to the lack of Porferio's conformity, petitioner did not validly acquire ownership over the property. 28 The CA also held that there is a need to receive evidence on the allegation of forgery. 29
Petitioner moved for reconsideration but it was denied by the CA in its October 9, 2014 Resolution. 30
Still aggrieved, petitioner elevated the case to this Court. Petitioner argues that the CA erred in: (a) ruling that the mortgage contract is void despite not being the subject matter of the complaint; (b) failing to rule on the issues relating to accion publiciana and rescission of the contract to sell, which are the subject matter of the complaint; and, (c) not holding that there is absolutely no pactum commissorium or equitable mortgage to speak of. 31 Nonetheless, petitioner prays for the reversal of the CA Decision and the rendering of judgment in its favor.
In their Comment, 32 the Bautista couple argue that petitioner raised factual issues to be resolved during trial; this in fact reinforces the propriety of the denial of the Motion for Summary Judgment. 33
Petitioner filed its Reply, 34 and reiterated its arguments.
Issue
The issue here is whether the RTC's denial of petitioner's Motion for Summary Judgment is proper.
Our Ruling
The petition lacks merit. The Court affirms the ruling of the CA; the RTC properly denied the Motion for Summary Judgment.
Preliminarily, the Court emphasizes that the CA did not rule that the mortgage contract is void; it merely stated the legal basis (Family Code) that a contract is void without the consent of the other spouse. The appellate court found it necessary to discuss the concept in determining the propriety of the denial of the Motion for Summary Judgment. Further, contrary to petitioner's statements in its Petition, the CA Decision did not touch upon the issues of accion publiciana, rescission of the contract to sell, pactum commissorium, and equitable mortgage. This does not mean, however, that the appellate court held that the instant case does or does not involve these matters. The CA deemed it not necessary to discuss these in determining the propriety of the denial. Because, again, the issue in the certiorari and the instant appeal pertains to the propriety of the denial of the motion.
Even if petitioner did not expressly raise in its Petition the issue of the propriety of the denial of the motion, the Court sees that this is subsumed in the errors assigned in the Petition. Thus, the Court shall resolve the question.
The Rules of Court allow for parties to move for a summary judgment of the case:
RULE 35
Summary Judgements
Section 3. Motion and proceedings thereon. — The motion shall be served at least ten (10) days before the time specified for the hearing. The adverse party may serve opposing affidavits, depositions, or admissions at least three (3) days before the hearing. After the hearing, the judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, supporting affidavits, depositions, and admissions on file, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. 35
Summary judgment is a procedural device that allows parties to avoid long litigation and delays, where the pleadings show that there are no genuine issues of fact to be tried. 36 A genuine issue of fact is ""such issue of fact which requires the presentation of evidence as distinguished from a sham, fictitious, contrived[,] or false claim."" 37 As such, an issue of fact is genuine if it requires presentation of evidence to be resolved. DETACa
To determine if genuine issues of fact exist, the Court stated in Philippine Racing Commission v. Manila Jockey Club, Inc.: 38
In Calubaquib v. Republic, the Court explained how trial courts may determine genuine issues in this manner:
""A summary judgment is permitted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and [the] moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" The test of the propriety of rendering summary judgments is the existence of a genuine issue of fact, ""as distinguished from a sham, fictitious, contrived[,] or false claim."" [A] factual issue raised by a party is considered as sham when[,] by its nature[,] it is evident that it cannot be proven[,] or it is such that the party tendering the same has neither any sincere intention nor adequate evidence to prove it. This usually happens in denials made by defendants merely for the sake of having an issue[,] and thereby gaining delay, taking advantage of the fact that their answers are not under oath anyway.
In determining the genuineness of the issues, and hence the propriety of rendering a summary judgment, the court is obliged to carefully study and appraise, not the tenor or contents of the pleadings, but the facts alleged under oath by the parties and/or their witnesses in the affidavits that they submittal with the motion and the corresponding opposition. Thus, it is held that, even if the pleadings on their face appear to raise issues, a summary judgment is proper so long as ""the affidavits, depositions, and admissions presented by the moving party show that such issues are not genuine."" (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)
Additionally, in order for summary judgment to be granted in lieu of a full-blown trial, the party moving for summary judgment must establish unequivocally the absence of genuine issues of fact or that the issue posed is so patently insubstantial as to constitute a genuine issue. 39
When a party moves for a summary judgment, the trial court is duty-bound to examine the motion and the supporting documents, as well as the corresponding opposition thereto, to determine if there are genuine issues of fact that should be resolved by the trial court.
Petitioner's Motion for Summary Judgment claims that: (a) the spouses Bautista admitted that the TCT of the property is in petitioner's name; (b) the Bautistas did not specifically deny the material allegations of the complaint; and (c) the defenses of the spouses Bautista (pactum commissorium, equitable mortgage), are legal issues, not factual. 40
On the other hand, the spouses Bautista's Opposition (to the Motion) insists that there are genuine issues of facts in the case, such as the existence of equitable mortgage, imposition of interest, and whether the contract to sell is pactum commissorium, and forgery. 41 These issues are likewise reflected in the spouses Bautista's Answer.
The Court finds that summary judgment will be improper the RTC is correct in holding that there are genuine issues of fact to be threshed out in the trial.
On petitioner's argument that the spouses Bautista admitted that the TCT is already in its name, the Court finds that this is just one of the pieces of evidence for the trial court to assess in making a ruling for this case.
On the argument on the lack of specific denials in the Answer, the Court is not convinced. Rule 8, Section 10 provides:
Section 10. Specific denial. — A defendant must specify each material allegation of fact the truth of which he does not admit and, whenever practicable, shall set forth the substance of the matters upon which he relies to support his denial. Where a defendant desires to deny only a part of an averment, he shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Where a defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of a material averment made to the complaint, he shall so state, and this shall have the effect of a denial.
""A specific denial is made by specifying each material allegation of fact, the truth of which the defendant does not admit, and whenever practicable, setting forth the substance of the matters upon which he relies to support his denial. The purpose of requiring the defendant to make a specific denial is to make him briefly disclose the matters alleged in the complaint which he intends to disprove at the trial, together with the matter which he relied upon to support the denial."" 42 An examination of the Answer reveals that the spouses Bautista made specific denials of the allegations in the Complaint:
ANSWER
DEFENDANTS, through counsel, in answer to the Complaint, unto this Honorable Court, respectfully state that:
xxx xxx xxx
3. They deny the allegations in pars. 4 to 7 the truth being that as stated in the Special and Affirmative Defenses and in the Compulsory Counterclaims;
4. They deny the allegations in par. 8 for being inapplicable to the case at bar as explained in the Special and Affirmative Defenses and in the Compulsory Counterclaims;
5. They deny the allegations in pars. 9 and 10 the truth being that as stated in the Special and Affirmative Defenses and in the Compulsory Counterclaims and they also deny the allegations in par. 10 with respect to entitlement for attorney's fees and appearance fees for being inapplicable to the case at bar as explained in the Special and Affirmative Defenses and in the Compulsory Counterclaims;
6. They deny the allegations in par. 11, the property being located in a prime subdivision in Davao City, it is worth several millions of pesos;
7. They deny the allegations in par. 12 for lack of knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the truth thereof; 43
The foregoing statements in the Answer suffice as specific denials as required by the Rules of Court. The spouses Bautista were able to point out the exact allegations in the Complaint that they intend to deny, even without expressly using the word ""specific,"" (or any of the word's derivatives), in the wording of the Answer. It is not required for them to set out the substance of the matters on which they rely to support their denial. The Rules state that the defendant can set out their basis for denial whenever practicable — there is no stringent requirement. aDSIHc
As regards petitioner's contention that the spouses Bautista's defenses of equitable mortgage and pactum commissorium are legal issues and not factual, We hold that the question of whether a contract is an equitable mortgage is a question of fact. 44 There is a need for the trial court to review evidence, including the assailed document itself, and the intent of the parties, to determine if there is an equitable mortgage, considering that the law provides for instances when a contract can be presumed to be an equitable mortgage. 45 The same goes with the existence of pactum commissorium: it is a question of fact as the trial court needs to look into the contractual stipulations, and the intent of the parties to determine, if there is such. 46 Though these defenses pertain to the preceding mortgage contract, resolving these in the trial will affect the resolution on the rescission of the contract to sell because, as alleged by the Bautistas, the former document is the basis of the latter. 47
Lastly, the spouses Bautista raise the defense that Porferio's signature in the contract to sell is forged. It is well-settled that the question of whether forgery exists is a question of fact. 48
Based on the foregoing, it is clear that there are still genuine issues of fact that need to be resolved in the trial. Hence, this Court holds that the denial of petitioner's Motion for Summary Judgment is proper (which, again, is the issue here in this appeal). Petitioner's recourse now is to participate in the trial proper.
Also worth mentioning is that the Court's pronouncement here is in line with the provisions of the 2019 Amended Rules of Civil Procedure on motions for summary judgment, which provides that ""[a]ny action of the [trial] court on a motion for summary judgment shall not be subject of an appeal or petition for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus."" 49
WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The September 25, 2013 Decision and October 9, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 02287-MIN are AFFIRMED. The Regional Trial Court, Branch 10, Davao City is ORDERED to continue the trial with DISPATCH.

HEIRS OF PROCOPIO BORRAS, namely: VICTORIANO BORRAS, LORENZO BORRAS, JOSE DESCALZO, ISIDRO CORDOVILLA, RODOLFO CORDOVILLA, represented by their co-heir and Attorney-in-Fact, RAUL CORDOVILLA, petitioners, vs. THE HEIRS OF EUSTAQUIO BORRAS, namely: ANGELINA B. GARAY, INOCENCIO BORRAS, ESTER SANTANDER, AMADO BORRAS, and PORFERIO BORRAS, respondents. 1
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
Before this Court is a petition for review on certiorari 2 assailing the (1) January 15, 2014 Decision 3 issued by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 124946, which dismissed the petition for annulment of judgment filed by the Heirs of Procopio Borras (petitioners), and (2) the August 14, 2014 Resolution 4 of the CA denying the motion for reconsideration thereof.
Factual Antecedents:
Procopio Borras (Procopio) was the owner of several parcels of land, one of which was Lot No. 5275 located at Barrio Bigaa, Legazpi City, and covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. [NA] 2097. Upon Procopio's death, the properties were inherited by his five children namely: Inocencio, Vicente, Aurelia, Severina and Leonila.
Upon the death of all the siblings, the properties were inherited by their respective children, including Eustaquio Borras (Eustaquio), son of Inocencio. 5
On April 10, 2004, the Heirs of Eustaquio (respondents) claimed ownership of Lot No. 5275. This was contested by petitioners. The dispute was referred to barangay conciliation which resulted to the discovery of petitioners that Lot No. 5275 is already registered in the name of Eustaquio Borras. 6
It appears that during his lifetime, Eustaquio claimed ownership over Lot No. 5275 when he filed a petition for reconstitution before the then Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay, Branch II, docketed as Cad. Case No. RT-1998 for the reconstitution of OCT No. [NA] 2097, with prayer for issuance of a transfer certificate of title in his name. 7 On July 7, 1980, the CFI issued an Order, 8 the fallo of which states: aCIHcD
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the City Register of Deeds of Legazpi City is hereby ordered to reconstitute the original certificate of title covering Lot No. 5275, Albay cadaster, in the name of:
PROCOPIO BORRAS, Filipino, of legal age, married to Francisca Azupardo, a resident of Legazpi City.
and thereafter, to cancel the reconstituted title and in lieu thereof, to issue a transfer certificate of title in the name of the petitioner, viz.:
EUSTAQUIO BORRAS, Filipino, of legal age, married to Magdalena Ascutia, a resident of Bigaa, Legazpi City.
using the documents herein presented as bases for the reconstitution of the title and issuance of the transfer certificate of title, upon payment of the corresponding legal fees.
SO ORDERED. 9
Pursuant thereto, Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 21502 10 was issued in the name of Eustaquio.
Upon learning of the existence of TCT No. 21502, petitioners filed an action for quieting of title before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Legazpi City, Branch 2, on October 12, 2004, which docketed as Civil Case No. 10402.
On June 21, 2007, the RTC rendered a Decision 11 in favor of petitioners, the dispositive part of which states:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:
1. Transfer Certificate of Title No. 21502, in the name of Eustaquio Borras is declared null and void;
2. Original Certificate of Title No. (NA) 2097 is reinstated as the valid and legal title over Lot 5275 in the name [of] Procopio Borras;
3. Plaintiffs' as well as defendants' claim for moral damages and attorney's fees are dismissed for lack of factual or legal bases.
No pronouncement as to cost.
So Ordered. 12
Respondents filed an appeal before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 90004, questioning the jurisdiction of the RTC in declaring TCT No. 21502 null and void. In its March 30, 2011 Decision, 13 the CA granted the appeal and ruled that the RTC had no jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of TCT No. 21502 in an action for quieting of title. The CA ruled that while a TCT should not have been issued to Eustaquio in an action for reconstitution, the declaration of its nullity can only be had either in an action for annulment of judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court before the CA, or in an action for reconveyance before the RTC. Thus, the CA reversed the June 21, 2007 RTC Decision, without prejudice to the filing of the proper action. A motion for reconsideration was filed by petitioners but it was denied by the CA in a Resolution 14 dated August 9, 2011.
Thereafter, petitioners filed before the CA a petition for annulment of judgment, 15 which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 124946. Petitioners sought the annulment of the July 7, 1980 Order of the CFI insofar as it ordered the cancellation of OCT No. [NA] 2097 in the name Procopio and the issuance of a TCT in favor of Eustaquio.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
On January 15, 2014, the CA dismissed the petition for annulment of judgment on the ground that petitioners failed to prove the existence of extrinsic fraud or lack of jurisdiction of the CFI when it promulgated its July 7, 1980 Order. 16 In dismissing the petition, the CA held that:
We therefore agree with petitioners that the trial court had exceeded its jurisdiction in a case for reconstitution of title when it ordered the cancellation of the reconstituted title in Procopio Borras' name and thereafter ordered the issuance of a new title in Eustaquio Borras' favor. However, this is not sufficient reason for Us to set aside the assailed Order.
The only grounds for annulling a judgment are extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defending party or over the subject matter of the claim. x x x For a petition for annulment of judgment on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter to prosper, petitioners must show not merely an abuse of jurisdictional discretion but an absolute lack of jurisdiction. Evidently, the trial court's action in excess of its jurisdiction does not fall within this requirement.
xxx xxx xxx
There is another reason why the petition for annulment of judgment must fail. A petition for annulment of judgment or final order of a regional trial court can be availed of only ""where the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of the petitioner."" From a reading of the allegations in the present petition, it appears that the issuance of a transfer certificate of title in Eustaquio Borras' name had been tainted with fraud. Considering petitioners' averment that they are presently occupying the property in dispute, petitioners are not precluded from filing an action for reconveyance. 17
Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration 18 but the appellate court denied it in its August 14, 2014 Resolution. 19
Hence, the instant Petition.
ISSUES
In this petition, petitioners raise the following assignment of errors, to wit:
A. WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE PETITION FOR ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENT IS THE PROPER REMEDY RESORTED BY THE PETITIONERS GIVEN THAT THE RESPONDENT TRIAL COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER AND OVER THE PARTIES WHEN IT ALLOWED THE CANCELLATION OF THE RECONSTITUTED TITLE IN THE NAME OF PROCOPIO BORRAS AND ORDERED THE ISSUANCE OF TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF TITLE NO. 21502 IN FAVOR OF EUSTAQUIO BORRAS IN A RECONSTITUTION PROCEEDING. ScHADI
B. WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE PETITION FOR ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENT IS THE ONLY REMEDY AVAILABLE TO PETITIONERS AS THE ASSAILED JULY 7, 1980 ORDER OF THE RESPONDENT TRIAL COURT WAS DISCOVERED BY PETITIONERS ONLY IN 2004 OR ALMOST 24 YEARS FROM THE DATE THEREOF; AND
C. WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN RULING THAT PETITIONERS' PROPER REMEDY IS A CASE FOR RECONVEYANCE COGNIZABLE BY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT AND NOT A PETITION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE JULY 7, 1980 DECISION OF THE RESPONDENT TRIAL COURT OVER WHICH COURT OF APPEALS HAS JURISDICTION TO DECIDE. 20
Petitioners insist that an annulment of judgment is the proper remedy given that the then CFI had no jurisdiction in ordering the cancellation of OCT No. (NA) 2097 and directing the issuance of a new one on favor of Eustaquio.
Our Ruling
The petition is without merit.
Annulment of judgment may either be based on the ground that a judgment is void for want of jurisdiction or that the judgment was obtained by extrinsic fraud. It is a remedy in equity so exceptional in nature that it may be availed of only when other remedies are wanting. 21
Lack of jurisdiction as a ground for annulment of judgment refers to either lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defending party or over the subject matter of the claim. In a petition for annulment of judgment based on lack of jurisdiction, petitioner must show not merely an abuse of jurisdictional discretion but an absolute lack of jurisdiction. Lack of jurisdiction means absence of or no jurisdiction, that is, the court should not have taken cognizance of the petition because the law does not vest it with jurisdiction over the subject matter. Jurisdiction over the nature of the action or subject matter is conferred by law. 22
The petitioner cannot rely on jurisdictional defect due to grave abuse of discretion, but on absolute lack of jurisdiction. The concept of lack of jurisdiction as a ground to annul a judgment does not embrace grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. 23
In this case, there is no question that the then CFI had jurisdiction over the petition for reconstitution at inception. Petitioners argue that the order of the CPI in cancelling OCT No. [NA] 2097 and directing the issuance of a new TCT in favor of Eustaquio was in excess and was beyond the scope of a reconstitution case. The purpose of a reconstitution action is merely to reproduce a certificate of title, after proper proceedings, in the same form it was when it was lost or destroyed. Hence, in such action, a trial court cannot order the cancellation of the original title nor direct the issuance of a new TCT in favor of another.
Section 12, in relation to Section 15, of Republic Act No. 26, 24 the governing law for judicial reconstitution, instructs when reconstitution of a title should be allowed, viz.:
Section 12. Petitions for reconstitution from sources enumerated in sections 2€, 2(d), 2€, 2(f), 3€, 3(d), 3€ and/or 3(f) of this Act, 25 shall be filed with the proper Court of First Instance, by the registered owner, his assigns, or any person having an interest in the property. x x x
xxx xxx xxx
Section 15. If the court, after hearing, finds that the documents presented, as supported by parole evidence or otherwise, are sufficient and proper to warrant the reconstitution of the lost or destroyed certificate of title, and that the petitioner is the registered owner of the property or has an interest therein, that the said certificate of title was in force at the time it was lost or destroyed, and that the description, area and boundaries of the property are substantially the same as those contained in the lost or destroyed certificate of title, an order of reconstitution shall be issued. The clerk of court shall forward to the register of deeds a certified copy of said order and all the documents which, pursuant to said order, are to be used as the basis of the reconstitution. If the court finds that there is no sufficient evidence or basis to justify the reconstitution, the petition shall be dismissed, but such dismissal shall not preclude the right of the party or parties entitled thereto to file an application for confirmation of his or their title under the provisions of the Land Registration Act. aICcHA
Clearly, the reconstitution of a certificate of title denotes restoration in the original forth and condition of a lost or destroyed instrument attesting the title of a person to a piece of land. The purpose of the reconstitution of title is to have, after observing the procedures prescribed by law, the title reproduced in exactly the same way it has been when the loss or destruction occurred. 26 A reconstitution of title does not pass upon the ownership of land covered by the lost or destroyed title but merely determines whether a re-issuance of such title is proper. 27
Here, while there is no question that the CFI acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it went beyond ordering the reconstitution of OCT No. [NA] 2097 by ordering its cancellation, and directing the issuance of a new TCT in favor of Eustaquio, nevertheless, such order of the CFI was done in the exercise of its jurisdiction and not the lack thereof.
Jurisdiction is not the same as the exercise of jurisdiction. As distinguished from the exercise of jurisdiction, jurisdiction is the authority to decide a cause, and not the decision rendered therein. Where there is jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter, the decision on all other questions arising in the case is but an exercise of the jurisdiction. And the errors which the court may commit in the exercise of jurisdiction are merely errors of judgment which are the proper subject of an appeal. 28
The lack of jurisdiction envisioned in Rule 47 is the total absence of jurisdiction over the person of a party or over the subject matter. When the court has validly acquired its jurisdiction, annulment through lack of jurisdiction is not available when the court's subsequent grave abuse of discretion operated to oust it of its jurisdiction. 29
Petitioners also cannot rely on the ruling of the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 90004 to claim that a petition for annulment of judgment is the proper recourse.
The pertinent portions of the Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 90004 are herein reproduced:
Be that as it may, it is open to serious doubt whether the RTC of Legazpi City, Branch 2, in the quieting of title case 10402, may render void the title ordered by the cadastral court, the CFI of Albay, Branch 2 in the name of Eustaquio. For this would have the effect of annulling a decision of another court of equal and concurrent jurisdiction. The defendants-appellants are correct in opining that the power is exclusive and original upon the Court of Appeals. To attack the cadastral court's decision for want or excess of jurisdiction, the plaintiff-appellee should have filed a case under Rule 47 with the Court of Appeals.
Putting to one side the question of whether there was a verbal partition of Lot 5275, the plaintiffs-appellees must first choose the right action wherein to raise the issue. It cannot be by an action to quiet a title that under the Property Registration Decree is already incontrovertible. It should have been an action for reconveyance. The SPA executed by the plaintiffs-heirs in favor of the Cordovillas hits the nail on the head. It had authorized the latter to file a case for reconveyance.
The theory in reconveyance is that, without altering the terms of the decree or title, the true owner may demand, on equitable grounds that the title be transferred to him. Cabanos vs. Register of Deeds, 40 Phil. 620, Recinto vs. Inciong 77 SCRA 196. The action is, moreover, imprescriptible if the plaintiffs are in possession. Chacon vs. Court of Appeals, 124 SCRA 784. Here, as testified to by the opposing parties, they were together in occupancy of Lot 5275 as far as they could remember having succeeded their predecessors-in-interest in the possession thereof. There is no reason why they could not have sued for reconveyance instead of quieting of title.
The cancellation of the title of Eustaquio Borras and its restoration in the name of Procopio Borras may be achieved either under a Rule 47 action with the Court of Appeals or in an action for reconveyance with the RTC in the exercise of its original jurisdiction. 30 EHaASD
Thus, it is clear in the ruling of the CA that petitioners could avail of either an action for annulment of judgment under Rule 47, or an action for reconveyance. The proper action would be dependent on the ground that petitioners would invoke in questioning the July 7, 1980 Order of the then CFI. Unfortunately, petitioners erroneously filed a petition for annulment of judgment based on the ground of the trial court's exercise in excess of its jurisdiction, which is not a ground in an action for annulment of judgment.
The proper recourse for petitioners should have been to file an action for reconveyance. This is a legal and equitable remedy granted to the rightful owner of land which has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in the name of another for the purpose of compelling the latter to transfer or reconvey the land to him. In an action for reconveyance, the decree of registration is respected as incontrovertible. What is sought instead is the transfer of the property, which has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in another person's name, to its rightful and legal owner, or to one with a better right. 31
Given the foregoing, the CA did not err in dismissing the petition for annulment of judgment.
WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. The January 15, 2014 Decision and August 14, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 124946, are AFFIRMED.

RICHARD N. WAHING, RONALD L. CALAGO and PABLO P. MAIT, petitioners, vs. SPOUSES AMADOR DAGUIO and ESING DAGUIO, respondents.
DECISION
LEONEN, J p:
The Court of Appeals has sufficient discretion to rule upon all relevant matters of a case, including substantive issues, in pursuit of the case's ""just and complete resolution[.]"" 1 However, while the Court of Appeals validly considered the case's facts, its denial of the employer-employee relationship merits reversal.
As rubber tree tappers, Richard N. Wahing (Wahing), Ronald L. Calago (Calago), and Pablo P. Mait (Mait) (collectively, Wahing, et al.) were placed under the operational and economic control of Amador Daguio and Esing Daguio (the Daguio Spouses), which created an employer-employee relationship between them and rendered Wahing, et al.'s dismissal from work illegal.
This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals Decision 2 and Resolution 3 setting aside the National Labor Relations Commission's Decision to remand an illegal dismissal complaint for further reception of evidence. 4 Instead of ruling on the procedural issues raised before it, the Court of Appeals decided the case on the merits and dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal upon finding that there was no employer-employee relationship between the parties. 5
Wahing, et al. worked as rubber tree tappers for the Daguio Spouses until Mait was ordered to ""stop tapping the rubber tree"" on October 15, 2006. On February 6, 2007, Waking and Calago were similarly ordered to stop working on the Daguio Spouses' trees. 6
Wahing, et al. then filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, reinstatement or separation pay, underpayment of wages, labor standards benefits, damages, and attorney's fees. However, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint ""after finding that the relationship between [the parties] was that of a landlord and tenant and not of employer-employee."" 7
Thereafter, Wahing, et al. appealed the Labor Arbiter's ruling before the National Labor Relations Commission which then vacated and set aside their complaint's dismissal and ordered the Labor Arbiter to decide the complaint on the merits. 8
When the Labor Arbiter ordered the parties to submit their respective position papers, only Wahing, et al. were able to file theirs, despite the Daguio Spouses being sent several notices to do so. Thus, the Labor Arbiter's September 28, 2010 Decision ruled that Wahing, et al. were illegally dismissed from employment. The Labor Arbiter then ordered the Daguio Spouses to pay Wahing, et al. a total monetary award of P777,090.52. 9 AaCTcI
Afterwards, the Daguio Spouses appealed the Labor Arbiter's findings to the National Labor Relations Commission, arguing that they neither received the Labor Arbiter's Orders to submit their position paper nor Wahing, et al.'s position paper. 10 The Daguio Spouses also moved to have their appeal bond reduced, which was partially granted, subject to an additional posting of P50,000.00 in cash or surety, as appeal bond. 11 In view of the Daguio Spouses' appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission issued an August 24, 2011 Resolution, ordering the case remanded once more for reception of the Daguio Spouses' evidence. The dispositive portion reads:
WHEREFORE, the Decision dated September 28, 2010 is hereby SET ASIDE. Let the records of the case be REMANDED to the Executive Labor Arbiter a quo for appropriate action and to dispose of the case on the merits.
SO ORDERED. 12
Wahing, et al. then moved for the reconsideration of the August 24, 2011 Resolution, but were denied relief. Thus, they filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, arguing that: (1) the National Labor Relations Commission had no jurisdiction to render the assailed Resolution because the Daguio Spouses failed to perfect their appeal; and (2) that contrary to the assailed Resolution, the Labor Arbiter respected the Daguio Spouses' right of due process by giving them adequate time and notice to submit their evidence, which they allegedly disregarded. 13
Instead of ruling on the procedural defects raised in the Petition for Certiorari, the Court of Appeals decided the case on the merits because the case had already been remanded multiple times and the parties' evidence had already been attached to the pleadings made part of the record. It found that the Daguio Spouses' evidence adequately refuted the existence of an employer-employee relationship, while Wahing, et al. merely relied on procedural technicalities and ""self-serving allegations."" 14
Further, since Wahing, et al. failed to overcome their burden of proving the existence of the employer-employee relationship, the Court of Appeals found that they could not have been illegally dismissed from employment. Thus, the dispositive portion from the Court of Appeals January 23, 2015 Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Resolution dated August 24, 2011 of the National Labor Relations Commission, Eighth Division, Cagayan De Oro City is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner's Complaint for illegal dismissal, reinstatement or separation pay, underpayment of wages, premium pay for holiday, holiday pay, rest day pay, service inventive leave pay, vacation/sick leave pay, 13th month pay, moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees is hereby DISMISSED for lack of basis.
SO ORDERED. 15
Wahing, et al. then moved for the reconsideration of the Court of Appeals' Decision but were again denied relief. 16
Thus, Waning, et al. filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before this Court, which argues that the Court of Appeals committed grave error when it ruled on the merits of the case despite these issues never being raised in their Petition for Certiorari. EcTCAD
Petitioners Wahing, et al. contend that there was no basis to appreciate respondents Daguio Spouses' evidence since they repeatedly failed to submit their position paper before the Labor Arbiter despite numerous notices. Petitioners also assert that, in any event, the National Labor Relations Commission had no jurisdiction to remand the case again to the Labor Arbiter for reception of respondents' evidence because the latter failed to submit the required surety bond to perfect their appeal. Thus, petitioners conclude that the Labor Arbiter's decision finding for their illegal dismissal should have been deemed final. 17
On substantive matters, petitioners contest the Court of Appeals' finding that they failed to establish the existence of an employer-employee relationship with respondents. Petitioners cite their co-workers' supporting affidavits, which allegedly establish their employment relationship with respondents. Petitioners also contest the Court of Appeals' reliance on Lirio v. Genovia 18 in justifying the Court of Appeals' review of the facts establishing an employer-employee relationship. According to petitioners, their Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, unlike the petition in Lirio, never placed the existence of the employer-employee relationship in issue. Thus, it was improper for the Court of Appeals to rule on an issue which was never raised by the parties. 19
In their Comment, respondents argued that the Court of Appeals properly resolved the case on the merits, because petitioners allegedly raised issues on: (1) the timeliness of respondents' appeal before the National Labor Relations Commission; (2) the propriety of resolving the issues without allowing respondents to present their evidence; and (3) petitioner's right to be paid ""holiday pay, premium pay for holiday, rest day pay[,] and etc."" Respondents also insist that the Court of Appeals' ruling on the merits is consistent with the parties' right to speedy disposition of cases. 20
On the timeliness of their appeal, respondents argue that they satisfied the requirement of bond posting when they complied with the order partially granting their Motion to Reduce Bond. 21 Finally, in support of the Court of Appeals' reliance on Lirio, respondents argue that the Court of Appeals was well within its authority to ""review the finding of facts of the NLRC and the evidence of the parties"" in determining grave abuse of discretion. 22
In their Reply, petitioners argued that respondents' motion to reduce their appeal bond failed to satisfy the legal standards for substantial compliance. Not only did respondents allegedly fail to post the required 10% of the monetary award appealed from, but they also failed to establish a meritorious ground for leniency in complying with procedural rules. According to petitioners, respondents falsely claimed that they were denied due process since they either failed or refused to submit their evidence and position paper despite due and repeated notice. 23 In any event, petitioners contend that Lirio does not apply to their case, and reiterate that it was improper for the Court of Appeals to rule on the merits of the case when the same were never raised in their Petition for Certiorari. 24
The issue to be resolved by this Court is whether or not the Court of Appeals gravely erred in resolving issues which were not raised on appeal by the petitioners. Subsumed under this is the issue of whether or not petitioners were respondents' employees.
We grant the Petition.
While the Court of Appeals correctly delved into the case's merits, it erroneously ruled that the parties did not have an employer-employee relationship.
I
The Court of Appeals has the authority to review and decide the case on the merits, consistent with the principle of judicial economy and in avoidance of ""dispensing piecemeal justice[.]"" 25 HSAcaE
In Heirs of Loyola v. Court of Appeals, 26 the Court of Appeals decided a case on the merits even when the petition for certiorari that raised the case for review questioned only the propriety of the case's dismissal on procedural grounds. The petitioners in Heirs of Loyola argued that since substantive issues were never raised in their petition for certiorari, the Court of Appeals gravely abused its discretion in ruling on the same. Citing Catholic Bishop of Balanga v. Court of Appeals, 27 Heirs of Loyola discussed the scope of issues that the Court of Appeals may validly undertake on review:
As a general rule, only matters assigned as errors in the appeal may be resolved. Rule 51, Section 8 or the Rules of Court provides:
SECTION 8.  Questions that May Be Decided. — No error which does not affect the jurisdiction over the subject matter or the validity of the judgment appealed from or the proceedings therein will be considered unless stated in the assignment of errors, or closely related to or dependent on an assigned error and properly argued in the brief, save as the court may pass upon plain errors and clerical errors.
This provision likewise states that the Court of Appeals may review errors that are not assigned but are closely related to or dependent on an assigned error. The Court of Appeals is allowed discretion if it ""finds that their consideration is necessary in arriving at a complete and just resolution of the case.""
Jurisprudence has established several exceptions to this rule. These exceptions are enumerated in Catholic Bishop of Balanga v. Court of Appeals:
True, the appealing party is legally required to indicate in his brief an assignment of errors, and only those assigned shall be considered by the appellate court in deciding the case. However, equally settled in jurisprudence is the exception to this general rule.
"". . . Roscoe Pound states that 'according to Ulpian in Justinian's Digest, appeals are necessary to correct the unfairness or unskillfulness of whose who judge. ['] Pound comments that 'the purpose of review is prevention quite as much as correction of mistakes. The possibility of review by another tribunal, especially a bench of judges . . . is an important check upon tribunals of first instance. It is a preventive of unfairness. It is also a stimulus to care and thoroughness as not to make mistakes.['] Pound adds that 'review involves matters of concern both to the parties to the case and to the public. . . . It is of public concern that full justice be done to [e]very one.['] This judicial injunction would best be fulfilled and the interest of full justice would best be served if it should he maintained that . . . appeal brings before the reviewing court the totality of the controversy resolved in the questioned judgment and order apart from the fact that such full-scale review by appeal is expressly granted as a matter of right and therefore of due process by the Rules of Court.""
Guided by the foregoing precepts, we have ruled in a number of cases that the appellate court is accorded a broad discretionary power to waive the lack of proper assignment of errors and to consider errors not assigned. It is clothed with ample authority to review rulings even if they are not assigned as errors in the appeal. Inasmuch as the Court of Appeals may consider grounds other than those touched upon in the decision of the trial court and uphold the same on the basis of such other grounds, the Court of Appeals may, with no less authority, reverse the decision of the trial court on the basis of grounds other than those raised as errors on appeal. We have applied this rule, as a matter of exception, in the following instances:
(1) Grounds not assigned as errors but affecting jurisdiction over the subject matter;
(2) Matters not assigned as errors on appeal but are evidently plain or clerical errors within contemplation of law;
(3) Matters not assigned as errors on appeal but consideration of which is necessary in arriving at a just decision and complete resolution of the case or to serve the interest of justice or to avoid dispensing piecemeal justice;
(4) Matters not specifically assigned as errors on appeal but raised in the trial court and are matters of record having some bearing on the issue submitted which the parties failed to raise or which the lower court ignored;
(5) Matters not assigned as errors on appeal but closely related to an error assigned; and
(6) Matters not assigned as errors on appeal but upon which the determination of a question properly assigned, is dependent. HESIcT
Thus, the Court of Appeals has the discretion to consider the issue and address the matter where its ruling is necessary (a) to arrive at a just and complete resolution of the case; (b) to serve the interest of justice; or (c) to avoid dispensing piecemeal justice. This is consistent with its authority to review the totality of the controversy brought on appeal. 28 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)
Thus, while petitioners here are correct that the Court of Appeals should generally review only the issues raised in the parties' pleadings, the Court of Appeals may review the case ""in its entire context"" to ensure its effective resolution, and to ensure the least cost to the judiciary and to the party litigants. 29
Petitioners insist that procedural defects in respondents' appeal before the National Labor Relations Commission, such as respondents' alleged failure to post the full appeal bond required by the rules, should have barred the case's remand for receipt of respondent's evidence. However, Tres Reyes v. Maxim's Tea House 30 provides guidance on the extent to which procedural rules may determine outcomes before the labor tribunals:
In labor cases, rules of procedure should not be applied in a very rigid and technical sense. They are merely tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice, and where their strict application would result in the frustration rather than promotion of substantial justice, technicalities must be avoided. Technicalities should not be permitted to stand in the way of equitably and completely resolving the rights and obligations of the parties. Where the ends of substantial justice shall be better served, the application of technical rules of procedure may be relaxed. 31 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
In view of the case's prolonged litigation, which stood to take even longer with the Commission's order of a second remand to the Labor Arbiter, the Court of Appeals properly took notice of both parties' evidence in order to resolve the case on the merits. AcICHD
II
As to petitioners' contentions regarding the posting of an appeal bond, Tres Reyes also deems this requirement as a procedural matter that may be relaxed in pursuit of substantial justice. 32 Further, Turks Shawarma Company v. Fajaron 33 discusses when compliance with the appeal bond requirement may be given leniency:
""It is clear from both the Labor Code and the NLRC Rules of Procedure that there is legislative and administrative intent to strictly apply the appeal bond requirement, and the Court should give utmost regard to this intention."" The posting of cash or surety bond is therefore mandatory and jurisdictional; failure to comply with this requirement renders the decision of the Labor Arbiter final and executory. This indispensable requisite for the perfection of an appeal ""is to assure the workers that if they finally prevail in the case[,] the monetary award will be given to them upon the dismissal of the employer's appeal [and] is further meant to discourage employers from using the appeal to delay or evade payment of their obligations to the employees.""
However, the Court, in special and justified circumstances, has relaxed the requirement of posting a supersedeas bond for the perfection of an appeal on technical considerations to give tray to equity and justice. Thus, under Section 6 of Rule VI of the 2005 NLRC Revised Rules of Procedure, the reduction of the appeal bond is allowed, subject to the following conditions: (1) the motion to reduce the bond shall be based on meritorious grounds; and (2) a reasonable amount in relation to the monetary award is posted by the appellant. Compliance with these two conditions will stop the running of the period to perfect an appeal. 34 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Petitioners themselves recognize that the National Labor Relations Commission granted respondents' Motion to Reduce Appeal Bond, 35 and that respondents ""submitted their compliance . . . by posting an additional bond of Php50,000.00."" 36 We find no issue with respondents' compliance with the statutory requirement.
The Court of Appeals validly decided the issues based on the arguments and evidence provided by both parties, which is more consistent with ""a just and complete resolution of the case [.]"" 37
III
Having resolved the propriety of the Court of Appeals' decision on the merits, this Court is now tasked with reviewing whether there was an employer-employee relationship between the parties. While this would entail a factual review, which is generally beyond the scope of a Rule 45 petition, the lower tribunals' conflicting prior findings on the existence of an employer-employee relationship gives basis for review. 38
Contrary to the Court of Appeals' findings, respondents employed petitioners as farm workers and are, thus, subject to the rules governing an employer-employee relationship. Consulta v. Court of Appeals, 39 citing Viaña v. Al-Lagadan, 40 discusses the four-fold test for determining the existence of the employer-employee relationship:
In Viaña v. Al-Lagadan, the Court first laid down the four-fold test to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship. The four elements of an employer-employee relationship, which have since been adopted in subsequent jurisprudence, are (1) the power to hire; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power to dismiss; and (4) the power to control. The power to control is the most important of the four elements. 41 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Respondents consistently argued before the labor tribunals that petitioners were not their employees because the latter ""only share[d] in the proceeds"" 42 of rubber sales from their tapping activities instead of earning wages. Respondents also deny exercising control over the means and methods of petitioners' work as rubber tappers. De Los Reyes v. Espineli 43 discusses that such a relationship may be classified as agricultural tenancy instead of agricultural employment: TAIaHE
We are here primarily interested in the basic differences between a farm employer-farm worker relationship and an agricultural sharehold tenancy relationship. Both, of course, are leases, but there the similarity ends. In the former, the lease is one of labor, with the agricultural laborer as the lessor of his services, and the farm employer as the lessee thereof. In the latter, it is the landowner who is the lessor, and the sharehold tenant is the lessee of agricultural land. As lessee he has possession of the leased premises. But the relationship is more than a mere lease. It is a special kind of lease, the law referring to it as a ""joint undertaking."" For this reason, not only the tenancy laws are applicable, but also, in a suppletory way, the law on leases, the customs of the place and the civil code provisions on partnership. The share tenant works for that joint venture. The agricultural laborer works for the farm employer, and for his labor he receives a salary or wage, regardless of whether the employer makes a profit. On the other hand, the share tenant participates in the agricultural produce. His share is necessarily dependent on the amount of the harvest. 44 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
De Los Reyes then teaches that the existence of agricultural employment may he determined by the same four elements of: ""(1) the selection and engagement of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the employer's power to control the employee's conduct."" 45 Thus, De Los Reyes examined the following circumstances in determining the existence of an employment relationship:
Since the relationship between farm employer and agricultural laborer is that of employer and employee, the decisive factor is the control exercised by the former over the latter. On the other hand, the landholder has the ""right to require the tenant to follow those proven farm practices which have been found to contribute towards increased agricultural production and to use fertilizer of the kind or kinds shown by proven farm practices to be adapted to the requirements of the land."" This is but the right of a partner to protect his interest, not the control exercised by an employer. If landholder and tenant disagree as to farm practices, the former may not dismiss the latter. It is the court that shall settle the conflict according to the best interests of both parties.
The record is devoid of evidentiary support for the notion that the respondents are farm laborers. They do not observe set hours of work. The petitioner has not laid down regulations under which they are supposed to do their work. The argument tendered is that they are guards. However, it does not appear that they are under obligation to report for duty to the petitioner or his agent. They do not work in shifts. Nor has the petitioner prescribed the manner by which the respondents were and are to perform their duties as guards. We do not find here that degree of control and supervision evincive of an employer-employee relationship. 46 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Both parties submitted testimonial evidence in support of their respective positions on the existence of the employer-employee relationship. Petitioners submitted testimonies from their co-workers detailing: (1) their daily wages for their required hours of work; (2) respondents' constant supervision of their workers during work hours; and (3) the possibility of dismissal from work for failing to serve three consecutive work days. 47 On the other hand, respondents submitted the testimonies of their ""former caretaker,"" a local rubber merchant, and several local government officials, who all testified that petitioners ""only share[d] in the proceeds"" of rubber sales and were not engaged as agricultural employees. 48 cDHAES
From the foregoing, there is sufficient corroborating testimony to support petitioners' claim that they served as employees on respondents' rubber plantation. Testimonies from petitioners' colleagues, who were similarly asked to leave the plantation, 49 illustrate that they: (1) were required to work at set hours per day; (2) were paid a set rate per day of work; (3) worked under the respondents' constant supervision; and (4) could be dismissed for violating the work standards set by respondents.
As to the element of control, rubber tapping does not lend itself to the usual standard of assessing an employer's control over the ""means and methods"" of an employee's work. As discussed in the Court of Appeals Decision, petitioners' work only required the collection of ""rubber lumps from the 'bagol' or small containers attached to the trunk"" and their placement in another container. 50 The activity may be better assessed for employer control through an alternative test, as provided by Francisco v. National Labor Relations Commission: 51
There are instances when, aside from the employer's power to control the employee with respect to the means and methods by which the work is to be accomplished, economic realities of the employment relations help provide a comprehensive analysis of the true classification of the individual, whether as employee, independent contractor, corporate officer or some other capacity.
The better approach would therefore be to adopt a two-tiered test involving: (l) the putative employer's power to control the employee with respect to the means and methods by which the work is to be accomplished; and (2) the underlying economic realities of the activity or relationship.
This two-tiered test would provide us with a framework of analysis, which would take into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding the true nature of the relationship between the parties. This is especially appropriate in this case where there is no written agreement or terms of reference to base the relationship on; and due to the complexity of the relationship based on the various positions and responsibilities given to the worker over the period of the latter's employment. 52 (Emphasis supplied)
The ""economic reality"" test discussed in Francisco requires proof of the ""the totality of economic circumstances of the worker[,]"" 53 in order to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship: TCAScE
Thus, the determination of the relationship between employer and employee depends upon the circumstances of the whole economic activity, such as: (1) the extent to which the services performed are an integral part of the employer's business; (2) the extent of the worker's investment in equipment and facilities; (3) the nature and degree of control exercised by the employer; (4) the worker's opportunity for profit and loss; (5) the amount of initiative, skill, judgment or foresight required for the success of the claimed independent enterprise; (6) the permanency and duration of the relationship between the worker and the employer; and (7) the degree of dependency of the worker upon the employer for his continued employment in that line of business.
The proper standard of economic dependence is whether the worker is dependent on the alleged employer for his continued employment in that line of business. In the United States, the touchstone of economic reality in analyzing possible employment relationships for purposes of the Federal Labor Standards Act is dependency. By analogy, the benchmark of economic reality in analyzing possible employment relationships for purposes of the Labor Code ought to be the economic dependence of the worker on his employer. 54 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Here, the testimonies submitted by petitioners establish the totality of economic circumstances required by Francisco's economic reality test. Petitioners perform services integral to respondents' business of running a rubber plantation. While there was no proof on record of petitioners' investment in their own work tools and facilities, the simplicity of the physical labor involved in their work renders this element inconclusive.
Likewise, the lack of proof of other plantations willing to employ petitioners cannot discount the proof presented that: (1) respondents exercised control over petitioners by constantly supervising them during their required work hours; (2) petitioners had no opportunity to exercise initiative or control their own profit or loss from their work, as they were paid a set daily wage; and (3) petitioners could be dismissed for repeatedly violating their required daily work engagements.
The foregoing circumstances, when applied to the two-tier test in Francisco, show that respondents exercised control over petitioners' hours, means, and methods of work. Petitioners were also shown to be economically dependent upon respondents for their livelihood. Thus, there exists an employer-employee relationship between the parties.
In any event, both parties offered the same type of evidence in support of their respective claims. Respondents' controverting testimonial evidence, sourced from a ""former caretaker"" 55 and several local government officials, is of equal weight with petitioners' evidence, at best. When the evidence between employer and laborer are of equal weight, the scales must tip in favor of labor, consistent with Philippine National Bank v. Bulatao: 56
Moreover, jurisprudence state that ""[w]hen the evidence of the employer and the employee are in equipoise, doubts are resolved in favor of labor. This is in line with the policy of the State to afford greater protection to labor."" 57 (Citation omitted)
Affording protection to labor and construing doubt in favor of the laborer are not only statutorily required under the Labor Code, 58 but are also consistent with the ""social justice suppositions underlying labor laws[.]"": 59 cTDaEH
Our laws on labor, foremost of which is the Labor Code, are pieces of social legislation. They have been adopted pursuant to the constitutional recognition of ""labor as a primary social economic force"" and to the constitutional mandates for the state to ""protect the rights of workers and promote their welfare"" and for Congress to ""give highest priority to the enactment of measures that protect and enhance the right of all the people to human dignity, [and] reduce social, economic, and political inequalities.""
They are means for effecting social justice, i.e., the ""humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces by the State so that justice in the rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated.""
Article XIII, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution guarantees the right of workers to security of tenure. ""One's employment, profession, trade or calling is a ""property right,"" of which a worker may be deprived only upon compliance with due process requirements:
It is the policy of the state to assure the right of workers to ""security of tenure"" (Article XIII, Sec. 3 of the New Constitution, Section 9, Article II of the 1973 Constitution). The guarantee is an act of social justice. When a person has no property, his job may possibly be his only possession or means of livelihood. Therefore, he should be protected against any arbitrary deprivation of his job. Article 280 of the Labor Code has construed security of tenure as meaning that ""the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by"" the code. Dismissal is not justified for being arbitrary where the workers were denied due process and a clear denial of due process, or constitutional right must be safeguarded against at all times.
Conformably, liberal construction of Labor Code provisions in favor of workers is stipulated by Article 4 of the Labor Code:
Art. 4. Construction in favor of labor. — All doubts in the implementation and interpretation of the provisions of this Code, including its implementing rules and regulations, shall be resolved in favor of labor. 60 (Citations omitted)
Social justice requires consideration for labor due to their disadvantaged position. The Court of Appeals should not have placed such an onerous evidentiary burden on petitioners given the evidence already on record. Both parties submitted competing testimonial evidence, giving sufficient basis to apply the principle of equipoise and rule in favor of labor.
In view of the employer-employee relationship between the parties, respondents illegally terminated petitioners' employment by ordering them to stop their work without just or authorized cause. Petitioners are entitled to reinstatement, and the payment of back wages and labor standards benefits from the time of their dismissal from employment until the finality of this Decision. 61 Should reinstatement be impossible or impractical due to strained relations between the parties, 62 respondents shall pay petitioners separation pay. Attorney's fees of ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award are warranted in view of the litigation costs incurred by Petitioners as a result of their illegal dismissal. However, there is no basis for an award of moral or exemplary damages as there is no proof of malice, fraud or bad faith in respondents' actions. 63 cSaATC
WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' January 23, 2015 Decision, and its July 7, 2015 Resolution, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
The September 28, 2010 Decision of the Labor Arbiter finding the existence of the employer-employee relationship and petitioners' illegal dismissal, and awarding back wages and other benefits is hereby REINSTATED, subject to the possibility of reinstatement in lieu of separation pay. Petitioners are likewise entitled to Attorney's Fees at the rate of ten percent (10%) of the entire monetary award.

[G.R. No. 258947. March 29, 2022.]
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, petitioner, vs. COURT OF TAX APPEALS SECOND DIVISION and QL DEVELOPMENT, INC., respondents.
DECISION
CAGUIOA, J p:
This is a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65 (with Urgent Prayer for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) 1 (Petition) filed by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) directly with the Court against respondents Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) Second Division (CTA Division) and QL Development, Inc. (QLDI), praying for the following reliefs:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that the instant petition be given DUE COURSE and after consideration thereof:
1. A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER and/or WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION be ISSUED against the Second Division of the Court of Tax Appeals, enjoining the latter from proceeding with CTA Case No. 10291 and from implementing the prohibition against petitioner from collection of deficiency taxes against private respondent, pending resolution of the instant petition;
2. A WRIT OF CERTIORARI be ISSUED declaring the Resolutions dated 07 June 2021 and 11 December 2021, as well as the Writ of Prohibition enjoining petitioner from collecting deficiency taxes against private respondent for TY 2010 as NULL and VOID for being issued with grave abuse of discretion and/or lack of jurisdiction, setting aside the same;
3. A WRIT OF PROHIBITION be ISSUED to the Second Division of the Court of Tax Appeals, enjoining the latter from proceeding with CTA Case No. 10291, and from implementing the Writ of Prohibition against petitioner, and ordering the said court to dismiss the said case for lack of jurisdiction.
Other relief just and equitable under the premises are likewise prayed for. 2
The CIR essentially challenges the June 7, 2021 3 and December 11, 2021 4 Resolutions in CTA Case No. 10291, which cancelled QLDI's deficiency tax assessment for taxable year 2010 on the ground of prescription and enjoined the CIR from collecting the assessed deficiency taxes against QLDI.
The Facts
On November 12, 2012, QLDI received a Letter of Authority (LOA) SN: eLA2010000021857/LOA-065-2012-00000060 5 dated October 30, 2012, covering taxable year 2010 for deficiency taxes. On November 28, 2014, the CIR served the Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) together with the Details of Discrepancies 6 to QLDI. 7 Thereafter, QLDI filed its reply to the PAN on December 15, 2014. 8
On December 12, 2014, the CIR sent out the Formal Assessment Notice (FAN) or Formal Letter of Demand 9 (FLD) with Details of Discrepancies to QLDI. 10 Despite receipt of the FAN/FLD, QLDI failed to file a protest within the 30-day period provided by law. Subsequently, as there was no disputed assessment to speak of, as no protest was filed, the CIR issued a Final Decision on Disputed Assessment 11 (FDDA), which QLDI received on March 3, 2015. CAIHTE
QLDI filed with the CIR a request for reconsideration dated March 30, 2015, which was denied by the CIR in the Decision dated February 4, 2020. 12 Consequently, the CIR ordered QLDI to pay the deficiency taxes and the compromise penalty for taxable year 2010.
Proceedings before the CTA Division
On June 30, 2020, QLDI filed a Petition for Review 13 before the CTA Division, challenging the CIR's February 4, 2020 Decision. Particularly, QLDI questioned the validity of the assessment against it, and the prescription of the CIR's right to collect taxes.
On March 5, 2021, QLDI filed a Motion for Early Resolution of the Issue of Prescription of Collection of Taxes with Motion to Defer Pre-Trial. 14 QLDI alleged in its Motion that the CIR's right to collect taxes had already prescribed as early as December 12, 2019, or five years from the date of mailing/release/sending of the FAN/FLD on December 12, 2014.
On February 1, 2021, the CTA Division issued an Order stating that ""Considering the manifestation of [the CIR's] counsel that he will no longer present evidence on the issue of prescription, but will instead present its evidence in the main case, the issue of prescription is now submitted for resolution."" 15
In the assailed Resolution dated June 7, 2021, the CTA Division held that the period within which the CIR may collect deficiency taxes had already lapsed. Accordingly, the CTA Division cancelled the assessment for deficiency taxes against QLDI for taxable year 2010.
The dispositive portion of the June 7, 2021 Resolution provided:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, petitioner's Motion for Early Resolution of the Issue of Prescription of Collection of Taxes — with — Motion to Defer Pre-Trial is GRANTED. Accordingly, the assessment for deficiency taxes for taxable year 2010 issued against petitioner and contained in the FAN/FLD dated December 11, 2014 and Questioned Decision dated February 4, 2020, is CANCELLED.
SO ORDERED. 16
The CTA Division ruled that when an assessment is timely issued, the CIR has five years to collect the assessed tax, reckoned from the date the assessment notice had been released, mailed, or sent by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to the taxpayer. Thus, in this case, the CIR had five years from December 12, 2014, or until December 12, 2019, to collect the deficiency taxes. However, the CIR issued the BIR letters for the collection of taxes on various dates in 2020, which were all beyond December 12, 2019. Accordingly, the CTA Division ruled that the government's demand for payment of deficiency taxes was already barred by prescription.
The CIR filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the CTA Division denied in its assailed Resolution dated December 11, 2021. The CTA Division enjoined the CIR from collecting from QLDI the deficiency taxes either by distraint or levy. It likewise held that its jurisdiction over ""other matters"" arising under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 17 (NIRC) includes the issue as to whether the CIR's right to collect taxes has already prescribed. The dispositive portion of the Resolution reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, petitioner's Compliance [Re: Resolution dated March 3, 2021] and Compliance [Re: Resolution dated 05 July 2021], are NOTED. Thus, finding the surety bond and the attached documents to be in order, the surety bond is hereby APPROVED.
On the basis of the posting of the Surety Bond, respondents are hereby ENJOINED from collecting from petitioner the amount of tax subject of the present Petition for Review either by distraint, levy, or otherwise by any other means provided for by law, until further orders from the Court.
On the other hand, respondents' Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Resolution dated 7 June 2021) is DENIED for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED. 18
Hence, the present Petition.
The Issue
The core of the issue is whether the CIR's right to collect taxes had already prescribed.
The Court's Ruling
After a careful study of the allegations and the records of this case, the Court resolves to dismiss the Petition and uphold the Resolutions dated June 7, 2021 and December 11, 2021 issued by the CTA Division.
The CIR availed itself of the wrong
remedy in filing the instant Petition
before the Court.
At the outset, it bears noting that the CIR directly filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court, alleging that the twin Resolutions issued by the CTA Division are interlocutory orders that cannot be appealed before the CTA En Banc. DETACa
In CIR v. Court of Tax Appeals, 19 the Court held that the CTA En Banc has jurisdiction over a final judgment or order but not over an interlocutory order issued by the CTA Division. In reaching this conclusion, the Court explained the concept of a final judgment or order and distinguished it from an interlocutory order, as follows:
In Denso (Phils.), Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, we expounded on the differences between a ""final judgment"" and an ""interlocutory order,"" to wit:
x x x A ""final"" judgment or order is one that finally disposes of a case, leaving nothing more to be done by the Court in respect thereto, e.g., an adjudication on the merits which, on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial, declares categorically what the rights and obligations of the parties are and which party is in the right; or a judgment or order that dismisses an action on the ground, for instance, of res judicata or prescription. Once rendered, the task of the Court is ended, as far as deciding the controversy or determining the rights and liabilities of the litigants is concerned. Nothing more remains to be done by the Court except to await the parties' next move x x x and ultimately, of course, to cause the execution of the judgment once it becomes ""final"" or, to use the established and more distinctive term, ""final and executory.""
xxx xxx xxx
Conversely, an order that does not finally dispose of the case, and does not end the Court's task of adjudicating the parties' contentions and determining their rights and liabilities as regards each other, but obviously indicates that other things remain to be done by the Court, is ""interlocutory,"" e.g., an order denying a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 of the Rules x x x. Unlike a ""final"" judgment or order, which is appealable, as above pointed out, an ""interlocutory"" order may not be questioned on appeal except only as part of an appeal that may eventually be taken from the final judgment rendered in the case. 20
Given the distinctions between a final judgment or order and an interlocutory order, there is no doubt that the CTA Resolutions dated June 7, 2021 and December 11, 2021, which cancelled the assessment against QLDI on the basis of prescription and enjoined the CIR from collecting the deficiency taxes for taxable year 2010, are final judgments or orders. The CIR's proper remedy on the adverse Resolutions of the CTA Division was to file an appeal by way of a petition for review with the CTA En Banc. Thus, the CIR's filing of the instant Petition before this Court assailing the twin Resolutions issued by the CTA Division is erroneous.
It is elementary in remedial law that the use of an erroneous remedy is a cause for the outright dismissal of the petition for certiorari and it has been repeatedly stressed that a petition for certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal. This is due to the nature of a Rule 65 petition which lies only where there is ""no appeal,"" and ""no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."" 21
Nonetheless, even if the Court were to disregard the impropriety of the remedy resorted to by the CIR, the Petition would still be dismissed.
The CTA has jurisdiction over the
case.
On the merits of the case, the CIR attributes grave abuse of discretion to the CTA Division when it assumed jurisdiction over QLDI's Petition for Review. The CIR claims that QLDI's failure to file a valid protest to the FAN/FLD rendered the assessment against it already final, executory, and demandable. As such, the assessments are not subject to judicial scrutiny, as it is already beyond the CTA Division's jurisdiction.
The CIR's argument must fail in light of Section 7 (a) (1) of Republic Act No. (RA) 1125, 22 as amended by RA 9282, 23 which confers upon the CTA the jurisdiction to decide not only cases on disputed assessments and refunds of internal revenue taxes, but also ""other matters"" arising under the NIRC:
SEC. 7. Jurisdiction. — The CTA shall exercise:
(a) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:
(1) Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue [Code] or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue[.] (Emphasis supplied)
Based on the foregoing provision, the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the CTA Division is not limited to cases involving decisions of the CIR or matters relating to assessments or refunds. In CIR v. Hambrecht & Quist Philippines, Inc., 24 the Court held that the issue of prescription of the CIR's right to collect taxes is covered by the term ""other matters"" over which the CTA has appellate jurisdiction:
x x x [T]he issue of prescription of the BIR's right to collect taxes may be considered as covered by the term ""other matters"" over which the CTA has appellate jurisdiction.
Furthermore, the phraseology of Section 7, number (1), denotes an intent to view the CTA's jurisdiction over disputed assessments and over ""other matters"" arising under the NIRC or other laws administered by the BIR as separate and independent of each other. This runs counter to petitioner's theory that the latter is qualified by the status of the former, i.e., an ""other matter"" must not be a final and unappealable tax assessment or, alternatively, must be a disputed assessment. 25
To be sure, the fact that an assessment has become final for failure of the taxpayer to file a protest within the time allowed only means that the validity or correctness of the assessment may no longer be questioned on appeal. However, the validity of the assessment itself is a separate and distinct issue from the issue of whether the right of the CIR to collect the validly assessed tax has prescribed. This issue of prescription, being a matter provided for by the NIRC, is well within the jurisdiction of the CTA to decide. 26 aDSIHc
The CIR's right to collect taxes had
prescribed. The three-year, and not the
five-year, period applies to this case.
Regarding the period to collect taxes, the CTA Division held that when an assessment is timely issued, the CIR has five years within which to collect the assessed tax. Considering that the collection letters were issued beyond five years, the CIR's right to collect from QLDI the assessed deficiency taxes had already prescribed.
Section 203 of the NIRC, as amended, which provides for the prescriptive period in the assessment and collection of internal revenue taxes, reads:
SEC. 203. Period of Limitation upon Assessment and Collection. — Except as provided in Section 222, internal revenue taxes shall be assessed within three (3) years after the last day prescribed by law for the filing of the return, and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period: Provided, That in a case where a return is filed beyond the period prescribed by law, the three (3)-year period shall be counted from the day the return was filed. For purposes of this Section, a return filed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day.
In CIR v. United Salvage and Towage (Phils.), Inc., 27 the Court held that in cases of assessments issued within the three-year ordinary period, the CIR has another three years within which to collect taxes, thus:
The statute of limitations on assessment and collection of national internal revenue taxes was shortened from five (5) years to three (3) years by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 700. Thus, petitioner has three (3) years from the date of actual filing of the tax return to assess a national internal revenue tax or to commence court proceedings for the collection thereof without an assessment. However, when it validly issues an assessment within the three (3)-year period, it has another three (3) years within which to collect the tax due by distraint, levy, or court proceeding. The assessment of the tax is deemed made and the three (3)-year period for collection of the assessed tax begins to run on the date the assessment notice had been released, mailed or sent to the taxpayer. 28
Applying the foregoing ruling, the Court holds that the CTA Division erred when it applied the five-year period to collect taxes. The five-year period for collection of taxes only applies to assessments issued within the extraordinary period of 10 years in cases of false or fraudulent return or failure to file a return. Indeed, Section 222 of the NIRC, as amended, provides:
SEC. 222. Exceptions as to Period of Limitation of Assessment and Collection of Taxes. —
(a) In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or of failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be filed without assessment, at any time within ten (10) years after the discovery of the falsity, fraud or omission: Provided, That in a fraud assessment which has become final and executory, the fact of fraud shall be judicially taken cognizance of in the civil or criminal action for the collection thereof.
xxx xxx xxx
(c) Any internal revenue tax which has been assessed within the period of limitation as prescribed in paragraph (a) hereof may be collected by distraint or levy or by a proceeding in court within five (5) years following the assessment of the tax. (Emphasis supplied)
Here, given that the subject assessment was issued within the three-year ordinary prescriptive period to assess, the CIR had another three years to initiate the collection of taxes by distraint or levy or court proceeding. Accordingly, since the FAN/FLD was mailed on December 12, 2014, 29 the CIR had another three years reckoned from said date, or until December 12, 2017, to enforce collection of the assessed deficiency taxes. Verily, prescription had already set in when the CIR initiated its collection efforts only in 2020. 30 The Court also notes that regardless of which period to apply, i.e., five years as determined by the CTA Division or three years, the CIR's collection efforts were, as they are, barred by prescription.
In an attempt to convince this Court that its right to collect the deficiency taxes had not yet prescribed, the CIR avers that the FDDA received by QLDI effectively operated as a collection letter for the satisfaction of deficiency tax liabilities. 31
The Court finds no merit in the CIR's assertion. ETHIDa
To reiterate, the CIR's collection efforts are initiated by distraint, levy, or court proceeding. The distraint and levy proceedings are validly begun or commenced by the issuance of a warrant of distraint and levy and service thereof on the taxpayer. 32 And a judicial action for the collection of a tax is initiated: (a) by the filing of a complaint with the court of competent jurisdiction; or (b) where the assessment is appealed to the CTA, by filing an answer to the taxpayer's petition for review wherein payment of the tax is prayed for. 33 However, in this case no warrant of distraint and/or levy was served on QLDI, and no judicial proceedings were initiated by the CIR within the prescriptive period to collect.
At this juncture, the Court ought to reiterate that while taxes are the lifeblood of the nation, the Court cannot allow tax authorities indefinite and infinite periods to assess and collect alleged unpaid taxes. Certainly, it is an injustice to leave taxpayers in perpetual uncertainty whether they will be made liable for deficiency or delinquent taxes. 34 The Court has elaborated on the significance of adopting a statute of limitations on tax assessment and collection in this wise:
The law prescribing a limitation of actions for the collection of the income tax is beneficial both to the Government and to its citizens; to the Government because tax officers would be obliged to act promptly in the making of assessment, and to citizens because after the lapse of the period of prescription citizens would have a feeling of security against unscrupulous tax agents who will always find an excuse to inspect the books of taxpayers, not to determine the latter's real liability, but to take advantage of every opportunity to molest peaceful, law-abiding citizens. Without such legal defense taxpayers would furthermore be under obligation to always keep their books and keep them open for inspection subject to harassment by unscrupulous tax agents. The law on prescription being a remedial measure should be interpreted in a way conducive to bringing about the beneficient purpose of affording protection to the taxpayer within the contemplation of the Commission which recommends the approval of the law. 35
The CTA has authority to enjoin the
collection of taxes; requirements.
The Court also rejects the CIR's argument that the CTA Division acted without jurisdiction when it was enjoined to collect taxes against QLDI. For the CIR, the CTA Division has no power to issue writs of injunction and prohibition, but may only suspend the collection of taxes. 36
While an injunction is not available to restrain the collection of taxes, 37 this rule admits of exception under Section 11 of RA 1125, as amended by RA 9282, which allows the suspension of collection of taxes if, in the Court's opinion, the collection may jeopardize the interest of the government and/or the taxpayer, viz.:
SEC. 11. Who May Appeal; Mode of Appeal; Effect of Appeal. — Any party adversely affected by a decision, ruling or inaction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Commissioner of Customs, the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Trade and Industry or the Secretary of Agriculture or the Central Board of Assessment Appeals or the Regional Trial Courts may file an appeal with the CTA within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such decision or ruling or after the expiration of the period fixed by law for action as referred to in Section 7(a)(2) herein.
xxx xxx xxx
No appeal taken to the CTA from the decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Commissioner of Customs or the Regional Trial Court, provincial, city or municipal treasurer or the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Trade and Industry or the Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may be, shall suspend the payment, levy, distraint, and/or sale of any property of the taxpayer for the satisfaction of his tax liability as provided by existing law: Provided, however, That when in the opinion of the Court the collection by the aforementioned government agencies may jeopardize the interest of the Government and/or the taxpayer the Court [at] any stage of the proceeding may suspend the said collection and require the taxpayer either to deposit the amount claimed or to file a surety bond for not more than double the amount with the Court. (Emphasis supplied)
Pursuant to the foregoing, the CTA may enjoin the collection of taxes if such collection will jeopardize the interest of the government or the taxpayer. In this regard, the Court ruled that the CTA has ample authority to issue injunctive writs to restrain the collection of tax, 38 especially in cases where prescription has set in. 39
To recall, the December 11, 2021 CTA Resolution enjoined the CIR from collecting the deficiency taxes against QLDI until further orders from the CTA Division. The Court finds that the CTA Division's act of enjoining the CIR from collecting deficiency taxes had sufficient basis, as it was centered on the finding that the CIR's right to collect the assessed deficiency taxes had already lapsed. Moreover, QLDI posted a surety bond, which the CTA Division approved.
On the strength of the foregoing observations, the Court cannot grant the CIR's application for injunctive relief. The CIR failed to establish that it is entitled to the reliefs demanded in the Petition. 40 Neither was it able to show the material and substantial invasion of a right sought to be protected. The application for a temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction is therefore denied. 41
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is DISMISSED. The June 7, 2021 and December 11, 2021 Resolutions of the Court of Tax Appeals Second Division in CTA Case No. 10291 are hereby AFFIRMED. cSEDTC

DECISION
J.Y. LOPEZ, J p:
This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision 2 dated February 6, 2018 and the Resolution 3 dated May 24, 2018 rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR Nos. 37649 and 37746. The CA Decision affirmed with modification the Decision 4 dated April 1, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 258, Parañaque City in Criminal Case Nos. 08-0820-24 and 09-0045-51, which found petitioner Martin R. Buenaflor (Buenaflor) civilly liable for the face value of the 12 checks he issued in favor of Federated Distributors, Inc. (FDI).
In 2006, FDI purchased from Buenaflor assorted pork products and made an advance payment of P5,831,000.00. Some of the products had to be returned as they did not conform to FDI's specifications. Despite repeated demands, however, Buenaflor failed to deliver the remainder of FDI's order. Subsequently, Buenaflor promised to return the balance of the advance payment of FDI in the sum of P4,444,829.97. He issued 12 post-dated checks in the amount of P100,000.00 each:

  All 12 checks were eventually dishonored because they were either drawn against insufficient funds (DAIF) or the account was closed. 6
This prompted FDI to institute a complaint for a sum of money against Buenaflor to collect his outstanding obligation, including the value of the 12 checks. On April 21, 2008, FDI also filed a criminal case for five counts of violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang (BP Blg.) 22 7 against Buenaflor docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 08-0820 to 24 before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Branch 78, Parañaque City. On July 21, 2008, FDI initiated another case for seven counts of violation of BP Blg. 22 docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 09-0045-51 before the METC. 8 The accusatory portion of the Information in Criminal Case No. 08-0820 reads:
That on or about the 29th day of June 2007 or prior thereto, in the City of Parañaque, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously issue to FEDERATED DISTRIBUTORS, INC. rep. by Grace B. Jayme to apply on account or for value the check described below:

  said accused well knowing that at the time of issue she/he did not have sufficient funds in or credit with the bank for payment in full of the amount of such check upon its presentment, which check when presented for payment within ninety (90) days from the date thereof, was subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank for the reason ""DAIF"" and despite receipt of notice of such dishonor, the accused failed to pay said payee the face amount of said check or to make arrangement for full payment thereof, within five (5) banking days after receiving said notice.
CONTRARY TO LAW. 9 (Emphases and italics in the original)
The respective Informations in Criminal Case Nos. 08-021 to 08-024 and 09-0045 to 09-0051 contained the same allegations except for the check number and the date. 10
Buenaflor filed a Demurrer to Evidence but it was denied by the MeTC on April 20, 2014. 11 The MeTC then proceeded to resolve the consolidated criminal cases.
On September 1, 2014, the MeTC rendered its Judgment, 12 the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, factual findings considered, this Court renders JUDGMENT:
1. DISMISSING CRIMINAL CASES Nos. 08-0820 to 24 and CRIMINAL CASES Nos. 09-0045 to 51, all for VIOLATION OF BATAS PAMBANSA BILANG 22, against the accused, MARTIN R. BUENAFLOR, the Prosecution having failed to establish his guilt beyond REASONABLE DOUBT; and
2. ADJUDGING the accused, MARTIN R. BUENAFLOR in CRIMINAL CASES Nos. 08-0820 to 24 and CRIMINAL CASES Nos. 09-0045 to 51, all for VIOLATION OF BATAS PAMBANSA BILANG 22, CIVILLY LIABLE for:
A. ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS ([P]1,200,000.00) for the face value of the twelve (12) checks, as ACTUAL DAMAGES;
B. TWELVE PERCENT PER ANNUM (12% P.A.) on the value of each check computed from the date of the filing of the criminal cases in Court, until fully paid, as INTERESTS;
C. TWENTY THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS ([P]23,250.00), for reimbursement of the filing and other fees in Court; and
D. TEN THOUSAND PESOS ([P]10,000.00), as and for ATTORNEY'S FEES.
SO ORDERED. 13
The MeTC was convinced that the elements of violation of BP Blg. 22 were not established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The MeTC found that while the first two elements of the crime were established because Buenaflor issued checks that were subsequently dishonored, the third element — that the accused knows at the time of the issuance that he or she does not have sufficient funds in or credit with drawee bank for the payment of the check in full upon its presentment — was not proven. The MeTC explained that FDI failed to notify Buenaflor personally and directly that his account had no funds or that it had been closed. For the MeTC, the prosecution should have presented other witnesses or documents to establish that Buenaflor received a valid demand letter from FDI. 14 In any case, considering that Buenaflor waived his right to present his evidence when he filed his Demurrer to Evidence, the MeTC found him civilly liable. 15
The MeTC pointed out that an earlier civil case had been instituted by FDI against Buenaflor to recover P4,444,829.97, which amount already included the value of the 12 checks subject of the criminal cases. The MeTC concluded that a recovery by FDI under one remedy necessarily bars recovery under the other. Thus, the MeTC opined that awarding the value of the 12 checks in the criminal cases will defeat the rule against unjust enrichment. 16 Nevertheless, in the dispositive portion of the MeTC Judgment, Buenaflor was still found civilly liable for the value of the checks in the amount of P1,200,000.00, twelve percent (12%) interest per annum, filing fees in the amount of P23,250.00, and attorney's fees worth P10,000.00. 17
Aggrieved, Buenaflor appealed to the RTC. On April 1, 2015, the RTC rendered its Decision, 18 the dispositive portion of which states:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed Decision dated September 1, 2014 is hereby AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION that the award of ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS ([P]1,200,000.00) for the face value of the twelve (12) checks, as ACTUAL DAMAGES and TWELVE PERCENT PER ANNUM (12% P.A.) on the value of each computed from the date of the filing of the criminal cases in Court, until fully paid, as INTERESTS are hereby deleted. The Decision is AFFIRMED in all other respects.
SO ORDERED. 19 (Emphases in the original)
The RTC deleted the award of civil indemnity in the amount of P1,200,000.00 for the face value of the 12 checks and the interest pursuant to the principle proscribing unjust enrichment. 20
FDI filed an appeal with the CA. On February 6, 2018, the CA rendered its Decision, 21 the dispositive portion of which states:
We MODIFY the assailed Decision dated 01 April 2015 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 258, Paranaque City, thus: we ORDER Martin R. Buenaflor to pay Federated Distributors, Inc. the following amounts:
1) Php1,200,000.00 (as actual damages), plus 6% per annum as interest, computed from the finality of this decision, until the award is fully satisfied;
2) Php10,000.00 as attorney's fees;
3) Php23,250.00, as costs of suit and other fees.
We DISMISS the Amended Petition for Review filed by Martin R. Buenaflor.
IT IS SO ORDERED. 22 (Emphases in the original)
Citing Section 1 (b), Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, the CA held that the RTC erred when it deleted the award of P1,200,000.00 plus 12% interest per annum. The CA ruled that when FDI filed the criminal cases for violation of BP Blg. 22 before the MeTC, the civil actions were deemed instituted. Thus, the MeTC could validly make a ruling regarding the civil award in the criminal suits. 23
The CA declared that the fact that FDI's counsel manifested before the MeTC that it should only rule on the criminal aspect of the cases was irrelevant because Section 1 (b), Rule 111 of the Rules of Court 24 prohibits a party from reserving to file a separate civil action. The CA also relied on FDI's manifestation and the testimony of its representative, Grace B. Jayme, who stated that FDI also seeks to recover the face value of the checks worth P1,200,000.00 in the present criminal cases. 25
In a Resolution 26 dated May 24, 2018, the CA denied the Motion for Reconsideration of Buenaflor. 27 Hence, this Petition.
Buenaflor argues that it is unjust and violative of his right to due process to disregard the manifestation of FDI's counsel during trial that it will not pursue the civil aspect of the BP Blg. 22 cases. He insists that he relied on such manifestation in deciding not to present controverting evidence for the civil aspect. 28 He also maintains that FDI committed forum shopping because it resorted to two different courts for the recovery of the same amount. 29
The Office of the Solicitor General filed its Manifestation and Motion (In Lieu of Comment) dated November 14, 2018, 30 asking that it be excused from filing a comment since Buenaflor's appeal is limited only to the civil aspect of the BP Blg. 22 cases. 31 Meanwhile, FDI filed its Comment, 32 claiming that Buenaflor failed to raise any substantial question of law that may warrant this Court's discretionary review. 33
In his Reply dated February 10, 2019, 34 Buenaflor merely reiterated his arguments in his petition.
The issues to be resolved are:
I.
Whether FDI may recover the face value of the checks worth P1,200,000.00 in the BP Blg. 22 cases when this amount was initially included in the civil case instituted prior to the criminal cases; and
II.
Whether FDI committed forum shopping in filing the BP Blg. 22 cases after instituting a collection case seeking to recover an amount which includes the face value of the checks.
I
FDI is not barred from recovering
the face value of the checks in the
BP Blg. 22 cases.
The CA is correct in awarding the face value of the checks amounting to P1,200,000.00. However, there is a need to clarify the reason behind this ruling.
In modifying the decision of the RTC, the CA relied on Section 1 (b), Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, the pertinent portion of which states:
SECTION 1.  Institution of criminal and civil actions. —
xxx xxx xxx
(b) The criminal action for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 shall be deemed to include the corresponding civil action. No reservation to file such civil action separately shall be allowed.
Upon filing of the aforesaid joint criminal and civil actions, the offended party shall pay in full the filing fees based on the amount of the check involved, which shall be considered as the actual damages claimed. Where the complaint or information also seeks to recover liquidated, moral, nominal, temperate or exemplary damages, the offended party shall pay additional filing fees based on the amounts alleged therein. If the amounts are not so alleged but any of these damages are subsequently awarded by the court, the filing fees based on the amount awarded shall constitute a first lien on the judgment.
Where the civil action has been filed separately and trial thereof has not yet commenced, it may be consolidated with the criminal action upon application with the court trying the latter case. If the application is granted the trial of both actions shall proceed in accordance with section 2 of this Rule governing consolidation of the civil and criminal actions. (Emphasis supplied)
It is settled that, as a rule, an offended party may reserve the right to institute a civil action. The quoted provision is an exception to the general rule and exclusively applies to a case for violation of BP Blg. 22. It states that the criminal action for violation of BP Blg. 22 is deemed to include the corresponding civil action and that no reservation to file such civil action separately is permitted. However, this prohibition contemplates a situation wherein a reservation to file the civil action arising from BP Blg. 22 is made after the criminal action is filed. It does not bar the institution of a civil action prior to the criminal action for violation of BP Blg. 22. 35
Citing the case of Hyatt Industrial Manufacturing Corp. v. Asia Dynamic Electrix Corp., 36 this Court explained in Spouses Lo Bun Tiong and Siok Ching Teng v. Balboa, 37 the rationale behind Section 1 (b), Rule 111 of the Rules of Court as follows:
x x x This rule [Rule 111(b) of the 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure] was enacted to help declog court dockets which are filled with B.P. 22 cases as creditors actually use the courts as collectors. Because ordinarily no filing fee is charged in criminal cases for actual damages, the payee uses the intimidating effect of a criminal charge to collect his credit gratis and sometimes, upon being paid, the trial court is not even informed thereof. The inclusion of the civil action in the criminal case is expected to significantly lower the number of cases filed before the courts for collection based on dishonored checks. It is also expected to expedite the disposition of these cases. Instead of instituting two separate cases, one for criminal and another for civil, only a single suit shall be filed and tried. It should be stressed that the policy laid down by the Rules is to discourage the separate filing of the civil action. The Rules even prohibit the reservation of a separate civil action, which means that one can no longer file a separate civil case after the criminal complaint is filed in court. The only instance when separate proceedings are allowed is when the civil action is filed ahead of the criminal case. Even then, the Rules encourage the consolidation of the civil and criminal cases. We have previously observed that a separate civil action for the purpose of recovering the amount of the dishonored checks would only prove to be costly, burdensome and time-consuming for both parties and would further delay the final disposition of the case. This multiplicity of suits must be avoided. Where petitioners' rights may be fully adjudicated in the proceedings before the trial court, resort to a separate action to recover civil liability is clearly unwarranted. 38 (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)
It is clear from the foregoing that a separate civil suit for the recovery of the civil liability in cases of violation of BP Blg. 22, when filed ahead of the criminal case, is allowed.
The proper course of action would have been to suspend the civil action until final judgment has been rendered in the criminal action in accordance with Section 2, Rule 111, 39 or to consolidate the civil action with the criminal action. However, in the present case, it is apparent that neither of these directions were pursued by the trial court despite its knowledge of the pendency of the separate civil case.
To this Court's mind, while the CA correctly found that private respondent is entitled to the face value of the 12 checks, it erred in relying on Section 1 (b), Rule 111 of the Rules of Court as its basis for ruling so. The provision is not applicable to the present case since the civil case was instituted ahead of the BP Blg. 22 cases. Instead, the proper basis for ordering petitioner to pay private respondent the face value of the 12 checks should be the Decision 40 dated May 13, 2015 of the CA in CA-G.R. No. 96212, which involved the civil case filed by private respondent against petitioner. The pertinent portion of the Decision is quoted below:
However, We are not unmindful of the fact that on July 22, 2008, appellee filed a Manifestation informing the court a quo that it instituted against appellee a separate criminal action for violation of BP 22. In the same pleading, appellee also asked that his claim in Civil Case No. 07-0301 be reduced accordingly. The Court will certainly not allow appellee to recover a sum of money twice in the amount based on the same set of checks. Neither will the Court allow appellee to proceed with two actions based on the same set of checks to increase its chances of obtaining a favorable ruling. In order to prevent double recovery or unjust enrichment on the part of appellee, the said amount of P4,444,829.97 must be reduced by P1,200,000.00, or the total amount for which the dishonored checks were issued. Thus, We reduce appellant's liability to P3,244,829.97.
xxx xxx xxx
WHEREFORE, in light of all the foregoing, the decision dated September 8, 2010 of Branch 257 of the Regional Trial Court of Parañaque City in Civil Case No. 07-0301 is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION in that defendant-appellant Martin R. Buenaflor is hereby ordered to pay plaintiff-appellee Federated Distributors, Inc. the amount of P3,244,829.97 with interest rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of the filing of the complaint until its full satisfaction. 41 (Citations omitted; emphasis in the original)
It is worthy to point out that in the civil case, the counsel of private respondent filed a Manifestation 42 dated July 22, 2008 stating that:
xxx xxx xxx
3. The [P]1,200,000.00 representing the total amount of the said checks is a portion of defendant's indebtedness to plaintiff in the sum of [P]4,444,829.97. Accordingly, to avoid double recovery, the amount of the aforesaid dishonored checks, now subject of the criminal cases aforementioned, should be deducted from plaintiffs claim in this case. Thus, [P]4,444,829.97 less [P]1,200,000.00, leaves a balance of [P]3,244,829.97, representing plaintiff's principal claim against defendant in this case. The reason for this Manifestation is Section 1 (b), Rule 111 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. 43
It must be noted that the decision of the CA in the civil case was brought to this Court through a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court docketed as G.R. No. 220841. 44 In an Entry of Judgment, it was certified that on December 9, 2015, this Court issued a Resolution denying the petition for failure to sufficiently show any reversible error in the challenged decision and resolution as to warrant the exercise of this Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction. 45 This Court confirmed that its Resolution became final and executory on June 13, 2016. 46
Indeed, Article 2177 of the Civil Code provides that ""the plaintiff cannot recover damages twice for the same act or omission of the defendant."" In this case, since the face value of the 12 checks with a total amount of P1,200,000.00 was already deleted to avoid double recovery in G.R. No. 220841, and this ruling had already attained finality on June 13, 2016, private respondent should be permitted to recover the amount in the present case. After all, these checks constitute an evidence of indebtedness of petitioner duly proven during trial yet remain unpaid.
A check is defined as ""a bill of exchange drawn on a bank payable on demand."" 47 As a negotiable instrument, it may be discharged under any of the methods enumerated in Section 119 of the Negotiable Instruments Law:
(a) By payment in due course by or on behalf of the principal debtor;
(b) By payment in due course by the party accommodated, where the instrument is made or accepted for his accommodation;
(c) By the intentional cancellation thereof by the holder;
(d) By any other act which will discharge a simple contract for the payment of money;
(e) When the principal debtor becomes the holder of the instrument at or after maturity in his own right.
In Ting Ting Pua v. Sps. Lo Bun Tiong and Siok Ching Teng, 48 this Court stressed that a check constitutes an evidence of indebtedness. This Court explained that:
In Pacheco v. Court of Appeals, this Court has expressly recognized that a check ""constitutes an evidence of indebtedness"" and is a veritable ""proof of an obligation."" Hence, it can be used ""in lieu of and for the same purpose as a promissory note."" In fact, in the seminal case of Lozano v. Martinez, We pointed out that a check functions more than a promissory note since it not only contains an undertaking to pay an amount of money but is an ""order addressed to a bank and partakes of a representation that the drawer has funds on deposit against which the check is drawn, sufficient to ensure payment upon its presentation to the bank."" This Court reiterated this rule in the relatively recent Lim v. Mindanao Wines and Liquour Galleria stating that ""a check, the entries of which are in writing, could prove a loan transaction."" 49 (Citations omitted; emphases supplied)
Here, the obligation of petitioner to pay the value of the dishonored checks subsists as the checks had not been discharged under any of the modes enumerated above. Therefore, private respondent should be permitted to collect the face value of the 12 checks.
II
FDI did not commit forum shopping
in filing the BP Blg. 22 cases after
instituting the separate collection
suit.
Forum shopping refers to the act of repetitively availing ""several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court."" 50 This Court has recognized the following instances as modes of committing forum shopping:
(1) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and with the same prayer, the previous case not having been resolved yet (where the ground for dismissal is litis pendentia); (2) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and the same prayer, the previous case having been finally resolved (where the ground for dismissal is res judicata); and (3) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action, but with different prayers (splitting of causes of action, where the ground for dismissal is also either litis pendentia or res judicata). 51 (Citation omitted)
Here, private respondent did not commit forum shopping. The criminal actions for violation of BP Blg. 22 may be pursued independently from the collection suit provided that there is no double recovery. While both actions are inherently related to one another and involve the same checks, they have different causes of action and the reliefs prayed for are not identical. In the criminal case, the primary objective is to punish the offender to deter him and others from committing the same or similar offense. On the other hand, the purpose of the civil action is to recover indebtedness.
To recall, private respondent initially sought to recover in the civil case the value of the 12 checks together with other amounts representing petitioner's indebtedness. However, after instituting the BP Blg. 22 cases, private respondent informed the trial court in the civil case about the BP Blg. 22 cases and asked that the face value of the checks be excluded from the award in the civil case. 50 This is consistent with Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court which states:
SECTION 5.  Certification against forum shopping. — The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed. x x x (Emphasis supplied)
The fact that private respondent promptly informed the court of the pendency of the BP Blg. 22 cases show that there is no intention to commit forum shopping. The manifestation of private respondent reveals that it did not intend to mislead the court or to claim more than what petitioner actually owes it.
All told, the CA correctly found petitioner liable for the face value of the 12 checks. The previously instituted civil case did not prevent private respondent from claiming the value of the checks in the BP Blg. 22 cases since the issue of double recovery was sufficiently foreclosed.
As a final note, this Court modifies the amount of interest imposed by the CA in its Decision. In Nacar v. Gallery Frames, 51 this Court laid down the following guidelines in the imposition of legal interest:
II. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:
1. When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% per annum to be computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.
xxx xxx xxx
3. When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 6% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.
And in addition to the above, judgments that have become final and executory prior to July 1, 2013, shall not be disturbed and shall continue to be implemented applying the rate of interest fixed therein. 52 (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied; citation omitted)
Pursuant to this Court's ruling in Nacar, the sum of P1,200,000.00, representing the face value of the 12 checks, being a forbearance of money, shall earn interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) 53 per annum from the filing of the 12 Informations until June 30, 2013 and thereafter, at the rate of six percent (6%) 54 per annum from July 1, 2013 until the finality of this Decision.
The total amount awarded to private respondent, including attorney's fees and costs of suit, shall further earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) 55 per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated February 6, 2018 and the Resolution dated May 24, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR Nos. 37649 and 37746 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.
Petitioner Martin R. Buenaflor is ORDERED to pay respondent Federated Distributors, Inc. the amount of P1,200,000.00, with interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the filing of the 12 Informations until June 30, 2013 and thereafter at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until the finality of this Decision.
Petitioner Martin R. Buenaflor is also ORDERED to PAY interest on the monetary awards in favor of respondent Federated Distributors, Inc. at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until full payment.
SO ORDERED.

If the criminal action is filed after the said civil action has already been instituted, the latter shall be suspended in whatever stage it may be found before judgment on the merits. The suspension shall last until final judgment is rendered in the criminal action. Nevertheless, before judgment on the merits is rendered in the civil action, the same may, upon motion of the offended party, be consolidated with the criminal action in the court trying the criminal action. In case of consolidation, the evidence already adduced in the civil action shall be deemed automatically reproduced in the criminal action without prejudice to the right of the prosecution to cross-examine the witnesses presented by the offended party in the criminal case and of the parties to present additional evidence. The consolidated criminal and civil actions shall be tried and decided jointly.
During the pendency of the criminal action, the running of the period of prescription of the civil action which cannot be instituted separately or whose proceeding has been suspended shall be tolled.
The extinction of the penal action does not carry with it extinction of the civil action. However, the civil action based on delict shall be deemed extinguished if there is a finding in a final judgment in the criminal action that the act or omission from which the civil liability may arise did not exist.

HEROLD C. UBALDE, petitioner, vs. HON. CONCHITA C. MORALES, in her capacity as the Ombudsman, respondent.
DECISION
J.Y. LOPEZ, J p:
This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Resolutions dated July 24, 2014 2 and February 12, 2015 3 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 127743, which affirmed the Joint Resolution 4 dated May 30, 2012 and Order 5 dated November 5, 2012 of the Ombudsman in OMB-C-A-11-0758-L, finding petitioner Herold G. Ubalde (Ubalde) and several others administratively liable for serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
The Facts
The present petition is an offshoot of the several cases arising from the so-called ""chopper scam,"" which involved the procurement of second-hand light police helicopters (LPOHs) for use of the Philippine National Police (PNP). At the time material to the case, Ubalde was the Director of the PNP Legal Services. In such capacity, he became a regular member of the PNP National Headquarters Bids and Awards Committee (NHQ-BAC). 6
The PNP, in relation to the 1st phase of its modernization program, included in its 2008 Annual Procurement Plan the purchase of three (3) LPOHs with an approved budget of P105,000,000.00. 7 Subsequently, after several amendments, the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) issued Resolution No. 2008-260 8 dated May 5, 2008, which prescribed the minimum standard technical specifications of the LPOHs, to wit:

  After two failed public biddings based on the prescribed specifications, the NHQ-BAC recommended that the procurement of the helicopters be made through negotiation pursuant to Section 53 (a) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations-A (IRR-A) of Republic Act No. 9184 10 (R.A. No. 9184).
On May 8, 2009, the PNP Negotiation Committee met with Manila Aerospace Products Trading (MAPTRA) Sole Proprietorship, which proposed to deliver one (1) fully-equipped and two (2) standard helicopters for P105,000,000.00, and BEELINE, which proposed the delivery of two (2) standard helicopters for P119,000,000.00. Considering that the proposals did not meet PNP's minimum requirement of three (3) equipped LPOHs, the negotiated procurement was declared a failure. 11
The successive failure in the biddings prompted Special Action Force (SAF) Director Leocadio Santiago, Jr. (Santiago, Jr.) to issue a Memorandum 12 dated May 14, 2009, requesting the procurement of at least one (1) equipped LPOH and two (2) standard LPOHs, instead of the original three (3) equipped LPOHs. The request was favorably indorsed by Police Director Luizo Ticman (PDIR Ticman) to the NHQ-BAC, which in turn, issued BAC Resolution No. 2009-22 13 dated May 29, 2009, recommending the purchase of at least one (1) equipped and two (2) standard LPOH units through negotiated procurement under Section 53 (b) of IRR-A of R.A. No. 9184.
Subsequently, PDIR Ticman issued a Request for Quotation for the negotiated procurement under Section 53 (b) of IRR-A of R.A. No. 9184 of one (1) fully-equipped and two (2) standard LPOHs from legally, technically, and financially competent and PhilGEPS-registered suppliers and manufacturers. 14
Meanwhile, on June 20, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Certificate of Incorporation 15 to an entity that goes by the corporate name Manila Aerospace Products Trading Corporation (MAPTRA Corporation).
On June 15, 2009, a negotiation conference was held. MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship participated in the negotiations and proposed to deliver one (1) fully-equipped LPOH for P42,312,913.10 and two (2) standard LPOHs for P62,672,086.90, or a total of P104,985,000.00 for the three (3) helicopters. 16 The proposal was accepted by the Negotiation Committee, which stated in its Resolution No. 2009-04 that the LPOHs were consistent with the NAPOLCOM specifications; the total price was within the approved budget; and MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship was a legally, technically, and financially capable supplier of helicopters, having been engaged in the business for many years and with available and existing service facilities. 17 The Negotiation Committee then formally recommended the award of the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship.
On July 9, 2009, the NHQ-BAC issued Resolution No. 2009-36, 18 which affirmed the Negotiation Committee's recommendation to recommend to the PNP Chief the award of the supply contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship. PNP Chief Jesus Verzosa (Versoza) subsequently approved the Resolution. 19
As a result, the PNP, represented by PDIR Ticman, and MAPTRA Corporation entered into a Supply Contract 20 dated July 23, 2009 (Supply Contract). MAPTRA Corporation obligated itself to deliver to the PNP brand new units of one (1) fully-equipped and two (2) standard LPOHs, in exchange for the contract sum of P104,985,000.00. Under the supply contract, the parties agreed that full payment shall be made through a disbursement voucher after the final acceptance of the units, and that partial payment for partial delivery is not allowed. 21 On August 4, 2009, Hilario B. De Vera, President and Managing head of MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship, executed a Certification under oath stating that the three (3) LPOHs subject of the Supply Contract are brand new, and that his statement is being made as part of the post-qualification requirements of MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship. 22
Consequently, Versoza issued Purchase Order No. 0(M)220909-017, ordering MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship to deliver the three (3) LPOHs to the PNP. 23 On September 24, 2009, MAPTRA Sole proprietorship delivered two (2) units of R44 Standard LPOHs to the PNP. 24
After the delivery of the LPOHs, the Weapons Tactics and Communications Division (WTCD) of the Directorate for Research and Development of the PNP was tasked to inspect and examine the two (2) delivered units to see if they conformed to the PNP's specifications. Subsequently, the WTCD issued Report No. T-2009-04-A, which stated that the method used for the inspection of the two (2) R44 Raven 1 LPOHs was ""Visual and Functional."" The WTCD made a table comparing the required specifications vis-à-vis those of what was actually delivered, with remarks on whether the prescribed specifications were met. The table showed that the delivered LPOHs conformed with most of the required specifications. With respect to the three-hour endurance requirement, however, the WTCD stated that there was no available data to compare the specifications required with what was delivered. The WTCD also noted that the delivered units were not air-conditioned, contrary to what was prescribed by the NAPOLCOM. It remarked that the ventilating system of the delivered units were that of a standard helicopter. 25
On November 9, 2009, the NHQ-BAC issued Resolution No. 2009-70, 26 recommending the amendment of the supply contract to allow partial payment to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship for partial delivery. Versoza approved the resolution. Subsequently, the PNP Inspection and Acceptance Committee (PNP-IAC) issued Resolution No. IAC-09-045 stating that the delivered units conformed with the NAPOLCOM specifications and passed the criteria indicated in WTCD Report No. T-2009-04-A. 27
Consequently, the PNP paid MAPTRA Corporation the amount of P49,680,401.80. After the remaining one (1) equipped LPOH was delivered and accepted by the PNP-IAC, the PNP again paid MAPTRA Corporation the amount of P49,680,401.80. 28
On November 5, 2011, the Field Investigation Office (FIO) of the Ombudsman filed criminal and administrative complaints against Ubalde and other high-ranking government officials for alleged anomaly and irregularities surrounding the sale of the LPOHs to the PNP. The complaint alleged that the sale caused undue injury to the government of around P34,000,000.00 and gave unwarranted benefits to certain individuals. According to the complaint, the irregularity attending the sale could not have been possible without the cooperation of and mutual help among NAPOLCOM and PNP personnel and officials, including Ubalde. 29
In its Joint Resolution 30 dated May 30, 2012, the Ombudsman found Ubalde and several others guilty of serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and imposed upon them the penalty of dismissal from service, with forfeiture of retirement benefits and perpetual disqualification to hold public office. 31 The Ombudsman held:
Applying now the foregoing criteria to the present case, there exist[s] substantial evidence to show that respondents Santiago, Jr., Ubalde, Villafuerte, Loreto, Saligumba, Antonio, Piano, Gongona, Paatan, Lukban, Recometa, Gaspar, Padojinog, and Dy, while in the exercise of their respective public duties and functions as participants to the questioned PNP procurement, conspired with each other to falsify documents, skirt procedures, circumvent rules, and defraud the government of millions of pesos in order to ultimately ensure the unwarranted benefit and pecuniary gain in favor of private respondents [D]e Vera, MAPTRA, and FG [Arroyo]. These unlawful acts, as exhaustively discussed earlier, certainly constitute serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service in that it caused severe pecuniary damage and prejudice to the government. Its immense debilitating effect on the government service certainly deserves the curtailment of respondents' privilege to continue holding public office. 32
Ubalde filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Ombudsman denied in its Order 33 dated November 5, 2012.
Aggrieved, Ubalde filed a petition for review before the CA. In its Resolution 34 dated July 24, 2014, the CA denied the appeal and affirmed the Ombudsman's ruling.
The CA found that the following factual findings of the Ombudsman were supported by substantial evidence: (1) MAPTRA Corporation was ineligible and not qualified to supply LPOHs because (a) its primary and secondary purposes were only to sell aircraft parts and spare parts and aircraft maintenance and repair, respectively, and not to directly sell new helicopters; (b) its only similar contract with the PNP was only worth P15,295,000.00, or below the law's requirement of at least 50% of the approved budget for the contract to be subject of bidding; (c) MAPTRA Corporation's net financial contracting capacity was negative; (d) it did not submit a commitment from a licensed bank extending to it a credit line and a cash deposit certificate in the amount of at least 10% of the approved budget for the contract; and (2) the LOPHs delivered by MAPTRA Corporation did not meet the standards prescribed by the NAPOLCOM. 35
The CA then affirmed the Ombudsman's holding that Ubalde, along with the other members of the NHQ-BAC, had the duty to ensure that MAPTRA Corporation is a legally, technically, and financially capable supplier of LPOHs. 36 With respect to Ubalde, for his failure to perform this duty, the CA found him guilty of serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
The CA denied Ubalde's motion for reconsideration in its Resolution 37 dated February 12, 2015.
Hence, this Petition.
Ubalde argues that the mere signing of NHQ-BAC Resolution No. 2009-36, affirming the recommendation of the Negotiation Committee to award the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship, cannot amount to serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. 38
Ubalde avers that he only relied on the determination made by the Negotiation Committee that MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship is a legally, technically, and financially capable supplier of helicopters. He refers to the affidavit executed by PDIR Ticman, in his capacity as the Chairman of the Negotiation Committee and Vice-Chairman of the NHQ-BAC, stating that the documents submitted by MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship were checked thoroughly by the BAC Legal and Technical Working Group (BAC Legal-TWG) which in turn, found the same to be in order and conforming with the requirements of the Negotiation Committee. 39 He insists that following the doctrine in Arias v. Sandiganbayan, 40 he had the right to rely on the evaluation of their subordinates or the members of the BAC Legal-TWG. 41
Ubalde further argues that contrary to the finding of the Ombudsman, the eligibility requirements under Sections 23.11.1 (2) and 23.11.1 (3) of the IRR-A of R.A. No. 9184 do not apply in negotiated procurement by reason of emergency. 42
In its Comment 43 dated August 10, 2015, the Ombudsman, through the Office of the Solicitor General, counters that only substantial evidence is required to sustain a finding of administrative liability. 44 In the case of Ubalde, he did not faithfully comply with his duty as a member of the NHQ-BAC when he affirmed the recommendation of the Negotiation Committee to award the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship, an entity which was clearly ineligible and unqualified to supply the PNP with LPOHs. 45 Contrary to Ubalde's assertion, negotiated procurement does not dispense with the requirement that the supplier be technically, legally, and financially capable. 46
Issue
The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding Ubalde administratively liable for serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service.
The Court's Ruling
The petition lacks merit.
It is well settled that only questions of law may be entertained in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The Court, not being a trier of facts, is not required to calibrate and weigh the evidence on record all over again. 47 Findings of fact of the Ombudsman, when affirmed by the CA, as in this case, are conclusive and binding on this Court. 48 While there are recognized exceptions 49 to this rule, none of them apply to the present case.
In administrative cases, the quantum of proof required to sustain a finding of guilt is only substantial evidence. 50 Substantial evidence has been defined as ""such relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds equally reasonable might conceivably opine differently."" 51 Indeed, ""the standard of substantial evidence is satisfied when there is reasonable ground to believe that respondent is responsible for the misconduct complained of, even if such evidence might not be overwhelming or even preponderant."" 52
In the present case, this Court is convinced that there is substantial evidence to hold Ubalde administratively liable for his acts relating to the purchase of the LPOHs by the PNP.
Both the Ombudsman and the CA found that Ubalde, as a member of the NHQ-BAC, approved the recommendation of the Negotiation Committee to award the contract to procure the LPOHs to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship despite a clear showing that the latter is not a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier. Particularly, the Ombudsman found that MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship did not comply with the eligibility requirements under Sections 23.11.1 (2) and 23.11.1 (3) of IRR-A, which state:
23.11. Eligibility Criteria
23.11.1. For the procurement of goods:
xxx xxx xxx
2. The prospective bidder must have an experience of having completed within the period specified in the IAEB concerned a single contract that is similar to the contract to the bid, and whose value, adjusted to current prices using the wholesale consumer price index, must be at least fifty percent (50%) of the approved budget for the contract to be bid.
However, (a) when failure of bidding has resulted because no single bidder has complied with the said requirement; or (b) imposing the same will likely result to a monopoly that will defeat the purpose of public bidding, the procuring entity, in lieu of the above, may instead require the following:
a) The prospective bidder should have completed at least three similar contracts and the aggregate contract amounts should be equivalent to at least fifty percent (50%) of the ABC of the project to be bid;
b) The largest of these similar contracts must be equivalent to at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the ABC of the project to be bid; and
c) The business/company of the prospective bidder willing to participate in the bidding has been in existence for at least three (3) consecutive years prior to the advertisement and/or posting of the IAEB.
For this purpose, the similar contracts mentioned under 2(a) and 2(b) above must have been completed within the period specified in the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid. The procuring entity can clarify in the bidding documents the similar projects that can be considered in the bidding.
Provided, further, that when the item/good to be procured is novel or its procurement is otherwise unprecedented or is unusual, and compliance to the requirement on a largest single similar contract is impracticable, the prospective bidder will only have to comply with requirement (c) above. 53
3. The prospective bidder must present a commitment from a licensed bank to extend to it a credit line if awarded the contract to be bid, or a cash deposit certificate, in an amount not lower than that set by the procuring entity in the Bidding Documents, which shall be at least equal to ten percent (10%) of the approved budget for the contract to be bid; or must have a NFCC at least equal to the approved budget for the contract to be bid, calculated as follows: NFCC = [(Current assets minus current liabilities) (K)] minus the value of all outstanding projects under ongoing contracts, including awarded contracts yet to be started. Where: K = 10 for a contract duration of one year or less, 15 for a contract duration of more than one year up to two years, and 20 for a contract duration of more than two years. 54
The Ombudsman found that MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship's only similar contract with the PNP was for the delivery of one (1) unit of Rotary Wing Trainer Aircraft in 2007 worth P15,295,000.00, or below the minimum 50% value of the approved budget of P105,000,000.00 for the contract to be bid in the present case. 55 Moreover, MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship did not submit a commitment from a licensed bank extending to it a credit line and a cash deposit certificate in the amount of at least 10% of the approved budget for the contract. Finally, MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship's net financial contracting capacity (NFCC) for 2008 was a negative P4,484,280.00. 56
To recall, the successive failure in the biddings and negotiation for the procurement of the planned three (3) equipped LPOHs prompted SAF Director Santiago, Jr. to request the procurement of at least one (1) equipped LPOH and two (2) standard LPOHs instead. According to the Memorandum dated May 14, 2009 issued by SAF Director Santiago, Jr., the SAF urgently needs the LPOHs in the conduct of their police operations, especially by those troops stationed in Jolo, Sulu, who have been deployed for more than a year without the needed air support, posing danger to their lives. The request was indorsed by PDIR Ticman to the NHQ-BAC, which then issued BAC Resolution No. 2009-22 dated May 29, 2009, recommending the purchase of at least one (1) equipped and two (2) standard LPOH units through negotiated procurement under Section 53 (b) of IRR-A of R.A. No. 9184. 57
R.A. No. 9184 requires that all procurement be done through competitive bidding. 58 The rationale behind this requirement is to ""ensure that the people get maximum benefits and quality services from the contracts"" and to promote ""transparency in government transactions and accountability of public officers."" 59 By way of exception, and if only to promote economy and efficiency, the law allows the procuring entity to resort to alternative methods of procurement, such as limited source bidding, direct contracting, repeat order, shopping, and negotiated procurement. 60
Negotiated procurement is a method of procurement of goods, infrastructure projects, and consulting services, whereby the procuring entity directly negotiates a contract with a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier 61 in highly exceptional cases. 62 Under Section 53 (b) of IRR-A, negotiated procurement may be resorted to in cases where immediate action is necessary to prevent damage to or loss of life or property. The procurement of the LPOHs falls under this category since as explained by SAF Director Santiago, Jr., the lack of air support in their operations in Sulu are putting the lives of their troops at risk.
On this point, this Court finds that contrary to the finding of the Ombudsman, the eligibility requirements under Sections 23.11.1 (2) and 23.11.1 (3) are not applicable to negotiated procurement under Section 53 (b) of the IRR-A.
First, Sections 23.11.1 (2) and 23.11.1 (3) on Eligibility Criteria are found under Rule VIII of the IRR-A entitled ""Receipt and Opening of Bids."" The opening provision of Rule VIII on the eligibility requirements for the procurement of goods and infrastructure projects provide:
23.1. The eligibility requirements or statements shall be submitted to the BAC in the form prescribed in Section 23.6 of this IRR-A and in the Instructions to Bidders, in a sealed eligibility envelope duly marked as such: Provided, however, That the minimum requirements provided for in this IRR-A shall be complied with. The eligibility envelopes of prospective bidders for the procurement of goods shall be submitted, together with the technical and financial envelopes, on or before the deadline specified in the Instructions to Bidders, and shall be opened on the date of the bid opening to determine eligibility of each of the prospective bidders. The eligibility envelopes of prospective bidders for the procurement of infrastructure projects shall be submitted on or before the deadline specified in the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid, and shall be opened before the dates of the pre-bid conference and opening to determine eligibility of prospective bidders, who shall then be allowed to acquire or purchase the relevant bidding documents from the procuring entity. 63
The succeeding provisions, Sections 23.2 to 23.11, lay down the procedure, as well as the requirements, for the evaluation of prospective bidders to be considered eligible to participate in the bidding. To emphasize, eligibility screening of prospective bidders and receipt and opening of bids are part of the process for competitive bidding. 64 In competitive bidding, several interested parties are invited to participate and be subject to qualification. This is in contrast with negotiated procurement where the procuring entity is allowed to directly negotiate with prospective suppliers.
Clearly, the provisions under Section 23 of the IRR-A are intended to apply only to the procurement of goods and services through bidding process, and not to the procurement of goods and services through negotiated procurement, which dispenses with the requirement of open, public, and competitive bidding. 65 Indeed, requiring a prospective supplier to comply with the extensive list of eligibility requirements under 23.11.1 (2) and 23.11.1 (3) will render nugatory the purpose for which the alternative modes of procurement is premised, that is to promote efficiency and economy. Applying the eligibility criteria to the negotiated procurement in this case will virtually eliminate the difference between a competitive or public bidding and an alternative mode of procurement — an incongruous situation which the law did not intend.
At any rate, the inapplicability of the eligibility requirements under Sections 23.11.1 (2) and 23.11.1 (3) of the IRR-A does not mean that in cases where the alternative modes of procurement are justified, the procuring entity is left without any standard or criteria provided by law. R.A. No. 9184 mandates that in all cases of alternative modes of procurement, the procuring entity shall ensure the most advantageous price for the government. 66 In De Guzman v. Office of the Ombudsman, 67 this Court also ruled that particular requirements are applicable to all types of procurement activity, including alternative modes of procurement, such as: (a) the conduct of a pre-procurement and pre-bid conferences; (b) the presence of observers during the entire bidding process; and (c) the publication of and/or posting of the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB). 68
With respect to negotiated procurement particularly, the law requires that the procuring entity directly negotiate with a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier. 69 Under Section 54.2 (d) of the IRR-A, which provides for additional terms and conditions for the use of negotiated procurement in cases of imminent danger to life or property under Section 53 (b), it is also provided that the negotiation shall be made with a previous supplier of good standing, thus:
54.2. In addition to the specific terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions on the application of each of the alternative methods specified in Sections 48 to 53 of this IRR-A, the following shall also apply:
xxx xxx xxx
d) For item (b) of Section 53 of the Act and this IRR-A, the negotiation shall be made with a previous supplier, contractor or consultant of good standing of the procuring entity concerned, or a supplier, contractor or consultant of good standing situated within the vicinity where the calamity or emergency occurred. The award of contract shall be posted at the G-EPS website, website of the procuring entity, if any, and in conspicuous place within the premises of the procuring entity. 70
In this regard, this Court finds that MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship/Corporation is not a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier nor a previous supplier of good standing based on the following undisputed facts found by the Ombudsman:
First, the NHQ-BAC affirmed the Negotiation Committee's recommendation to recommend to the PNP Chief the award of the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship, the entity actively engaged during the negotiation conference on June 15, 2009. The party to the Supply Contract, however, was eventually MAPTRA Corporation, which was issued a Certificate of Incorporation only on June 10, 2009. In the Articles of Incorporation of MAPTRA Corporation, it states that its primary purpose is for the ""sale of aircraft parts and spare parts,"" while its secondary purpose is for ""aircraft maintenance and repair of aircraft engine"" only. 71 There is no evidence that MAPTRA Corporation is also authorized to engage in the sale of helicopters. In fact, the documents submitted by MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship disclose that it had so far supplied only one (1) unit of helicopter, while the rest of its transactions involved the sale of spare parts and maintenance, viz.:
  Corporation/Company
Nature of Contract
Amount
DPWH
Sale of spare parts
Php3,068,963.66
Allied Banking Corporation

ABS-CBN
Maintenance
USD348,099.60
Tanduay Distilleries, Inc.
Sale of spare parts
Php2,742,604 72
  Second, as seen from its previous transactions, MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship's single largest contract similar to the purchase of the LPOHs is the sale of one (1) Rotary Wing Trainer Aircraft to the Philippine Navy worth only P15,295,000.00. To emphasize, the value of the Supply Contract for the purchase of the LPOHs in the present case is worth P104,985,000.00, or almost six times the value of MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship's single largest contract. There is also no showing that MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship had previously supplied helicopters to the PNP, which to be sure, is a separate and distinct entity from the Philippine Navy.
Third, as early as the negotiation stage, there were indications that MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship could not deliver the LPOHs compliant with the specifications required by the NAPOLCOM. MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship's formal proposal submitted during the meeting on June 15, 2009 consisted of reconditioned units with expired engine warranties and high flying time records. While the minutes of the negotiation show that there were questions on whether the proposed units to be delivered are brand new, there was no thorough evaluation if they are really compliant with the NAPOLCOM's specifications. In fact, the proposal of MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship also contained a brochure stating that the R44 Raven I helicopters are not air-conditioned, contrary to the requirement of the NAPOLCOM. 73 As it is, the records do not indicate any real effort to thoroughly examine the capability of MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship to deliver the helicopters in accordance with the prescribed requirements of the NAPOLCOM.
Fourth, the financial documents submitted by MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship show that it had current assets in 2007 and 2008 in the amount of P14,180,600.00 and P11,594,832.00, respectively, and current liabilities in the amount of P13,803,844.00 and P12,043,260.00, respectively. 74 Thus, in the two years preceding the award of the contract, MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship had a negative net worth of P376,756.00 and P448,428.00, respectively.
In affirming the recommendation of the Negotiation Committee to award the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship despite a showing that it is not a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier, Ubalde reneged on his obligation as a member of the NHQ-BAC to ensure that standards and criteria laid down by law for negotiated procurement are complied with by the prospective supplier. Under Section 12 of R.A. No. 9184, the functions of the BAC in the procurement process are:
SECTION 12. Functions of the BAC. — The BAC shall have the following functions: advertise and/or post the invitation to bid, conduct pre-procurement and pre-bid conferences, determine the eligibility of prospective bidders, receive bids, conduct the evaluation of bids, undertake post-qualification proceedings, recommend award of contracts to the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative: Provided, That in the event the Head of the Procuring Entity shall disapprove such recommendation, such disapproval shall be based only on valid, reasonable and justifiable grounds to be expressed in writing, copy furnished the BAC; recommend the imposition of sanctions in accordance with Article XXIII, and perform such other related functions as may be necessary, including the creation of a Technical Working Group from a pool of technical, financial and/or legal experts to assist in the procurement process.
In proper cases, the BAC shall also recommend to the Head of the Procuring Entity the use of Alternative Methods of Procurement as provided for in Article XVI hereof.
The BAC shall be responsible for ensuring that the Procuring Entity abides by the standards set forth by this Act and the IRR, and it shall prepare a procurement monitoring report that shall be approved and submitted by the Head of the Procuring Entity to the GPPB on a semestral basis. The contents and coverage of this report shall be provided in the IRR. 75
Under the law, the responsibility to determine the eligibility and qualifications of a prospective bidder falls upon the BAC. This obligation holds true even if a procuring entity is justified to resort to alternative modes of procurement. Admittedly, in negotiated procurement, the procuring entity directly negotiates a contract with a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier. This cannot mean, however, that the BAC's role in negotiated procurement is altogether removed. On the contrary, the BAC's responsibility includes ensuring that the procuring entity abides by the standards set forth by R.A. No. 9184 and its IRR.
Ubalde cannot escape liability by insisting that he merely relied on the determination of the Negotiation Committee that MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship is a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier of helicopters based on the evaluation trade by the BAC Legal-TWG. Under the Manual of Procedures for the Procurement of Goods and Services, Volume 2, the following steps are undertaken for negotiated procurement:
The following steps are undertaken in purchasing goods through the negotiated procurement method:
1. The method of procurement to be used shall be as indicated in the approved APP. If the original mode of procurement recommended in the APP was Public Bidding but cannot be ultimately pursued, the BAC, through a resolution shall justify and recommend the change in the mode of procurement to be approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity.
2. The BAC convenes the appropriate officials for the pre-procurement conference, if deemed necessary.
3. The BAC, through the Secretariat, posts for information purposes the procurement opportunity, for a period of seven (7) calendar days, in: a. The PhilGEPS; b. The website of the Procuring Entity and its electronic procurement service provider, if any; and c. Any conspicuous place in the premises of the Procuring Entity. For negotiated procurements in cases of imminent danger to life and property, the Procuring Entity may waive the period for posting. However, the award will be posted in the aforementioned sites. (IRR-A Section 54.2 [d])
4. If the procurement is being negotiated because of two previous failures of bidding or in case of imminent danger to life or property, the BAC, through the BAC Secretariat, issues invitations to at least three (3) suppliers of good standing for the latter to negotiate a contract. The Procuring Entity may draw these suppliers from its list of registered suppliers. The procedures for the conduct of public bidding should be observed. However, the minimum period for each bidding procedure may be reduced.
5. The suppliers submit their proposals in a sealed envelope duly marked.
6. The BAC, with the assistance of the TWG, evaluates the price tenders of the bidders. The BAC shall issue a resolution recommending to the Head of the Procuring Entity of the award of the contract to the lowest calculated and responsive bidder for approval.
7. The BAC Secretariat/Procurement Unit prepares the contract, Purchase Order or Job Order for approval of the appropriate authorities, and serves the same to the winning bidder. 76
Indeed, the NHQ-BAC in this case was mandated to take an active role during the process of negotiated procurement as it was tasked with taking the lead in evaluating the offers of the prospective bidders. The BAC Legal-TWG's function was only to assist.
Ubalde cannot take solace in the case of Arias v. Sandiganbayan, 77 which involved the head of an agency who pre-audited and approved the payment for the purchase of improvements by Pasig City, the supporting documents for which turned out to be falsified. In that case, this Court acquitted Arias for violation of Section 3 (e) 78 of Republic Act No. 3019, 79 ruling that ""heads of offices have to rely a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations."" 80
Here, Ubalde signed the resolution affirming the recommendation of the Negotiation Committee to award the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship not as a head of agency, but in his capacity as a member of the NHQ-BAC, the legally mandated body to vet the qualifications of prospective bidders and/or suppliers. 81 In any case, it is now recognized that the application of Arias is not absolute, such as in cases where exceptional circumstances exist that should have prodded the head of agency to go beyond what his subordinates prepared or recommended. 82
Yet, the Ombudsman and the CA incorrectly characterized Ubalde's offense as serious dishonesty. It is settled that ""the designation of the offense or offenses with which a person is charged in an administrative case is not controlling and one may be found guilty of another offense, where the substance of the allegations and evidence presented sufficiently proves one's guilt."" 83
Dishonesty is defined as the ""disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; unworthiness, lack of integrity [x x x]."" 84 It is the ""concealment or distortion of truth in a matter of fact relevant to one's office or connected with the performance of his duties."" 85 In the present case, there is no evidence that Ubalde lied, cheated, or deceived when he affirmed the recommendation to approve the award of the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship. Rather, the records show that he solely relied on the findings of the Negotiation Committee and the BAC Legal-TWG that MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship is supposedly a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier, thereby seriously violating his legal duties as a member of the NHQ-BAC.
Instead, this Court finds that Ubalde is guilty of grave misconduct.
Misconduct is the ""transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross neglect of duty by a public officer."" 86 It is considered grave when the elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law or disregard established rules are also present. 87
In the present case, Ubalde, as a member of the NHQ-BAC, disregarded the established rules on negotiated procurement when it failed to determine the true eligibility and qualification of MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship to supply the LPOHs to the PNP. He violated several provisions of R.A. No. 9184, its IRR-A, and the Manual of Procedures for the Procurement of Goods and Services, Volume 2 when he relegated his function as a mere approving authority of the findings of the Negotiation Committee and the BAC Legal-TWG and grossly failed to abide by his duty to ensure that the criteria and standards laid down by law were met.
As a result of his actions, Ubalde, along with the other members of the NHQ-BAC, gave unwarranted benefits and advantages to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship, to the damage and prejudice of the government. To note, the award of the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship could not have been possible without the participation and recommendation of the NHQ-BAC. Thus, for blatant and willful disregard of procurement rules, Ubalde is liable for grave misconduct, punishable by dismissal from service. 88
Finally, this Court agrees with the Ombudsman and the CA that Ubalde is also liable for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service because his acts ""tarnished the image and integrity of [his] public office."" 89 His participation in the award of the contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship in gross disregard of procurement rules, eventually causing damage to the government, diminished the faith of the people in the service.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED. The Resolutions dated July 24, 2014 and February 12, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 127743 arc hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Herold G. Ubalde is GUILTY of grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. He is DISMISSED from the service, with all its accessory penalties.
SO ORDERED.

[G.R. No. 248815. March 23, 2022.]
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, plaintiff-appellee, vs. XXX, 1 accused-appellant.
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
This appeal 2 seeks the reversal of the April 8, 2019 Decision 3 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 08573, which affirmed with modification the June 27, 2016 Decision 4 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of _____________, 5 Branch 130, in Criminal Case Nos. C-87527 and C-87528 finding accused-appellant XXX (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Qualified Trafficking in Persons and Rape.
The Factual Antecedents:
Accused-appellant was charged with two counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 6 (a), in relation to Section 4 (e), 3 and 10 (c), of Republic Act No. (RA) 9208, 6 otherwise known as the ""Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003,"" and one count of Rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 (a) of the Revised Penal Code, based on the following three Informations, to wit:
In Criminal Case No. C-87527:
That on or about the third week of September 2011, ____________, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by taking advantage of the vulnerability of a 14 year old child, AAA, 7 did then and there, for profit, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously hire or maintain the latter to engage in sexual intercourse with men in exchange for money or any other consideration, thereby making a prostitute out of the said victim, to her damage and prejudice.
That the crime was attended by the qualifying circumstance of minority, the complainant AAA being only 14 years of age.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
In Criminal Case No. C-87528:
That on or about the 12th day of September 2011, in __________, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have carnal knowledge of AAA, a fourteen (14) year-old minor, by forcibly undressing the latter, preventing her from running away and thereafter inserting his penis into her vagina, to the damage and prejudice of the said minor victim.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
In Criminal Case No. C-87606:
That on or about the third week of September 2011, in ___________, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by taking advantage of the vulnerability of a 13 year old child, BBB, 8 did then and there, for profit, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously hire or maintain the latter to engage in sexual intercourse with men in exchange for money or any other consideration, thereby making a prostitute out of the said victim, to her damage and prejudice.
That the crime was attended by the qualifying circumstance of minority, the complainant BBB being only 13 years of age.
CONTRARY TO LAW. 9
Upon his arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded ""not guilty"" to the crimes charged. After the termination of pre-trial, trial on the merits subsequently ensued. 10
Version of the Prosecution:
On September 8, 2011, at around 11:00 p.m., AAA, who was then only 14 years old, 11 went with her friend, BBB, to _______________________________ to meet with the latter's ""textmates."" 12 Upon arriving at the hotel, BBB introduced AAA to accused-appellant and an unidentified man. Afterwards, the two men booked two separate rooms and all four of them proceeded to go upstairs. 13
At first, they all stayed in one room where accused-appellant tried to get to know AAA. After some time, AAA noticed that her companions were holding a folded foil paper. Accused-appellant then asked AAA if she wanted to try it out, which turned out to be ""enchang"" or shabu. AAA initially declined the offer but BBB eventually convinced her to join in and try the substance. Thereafter, BBB asked AAA and accused-appellant to leave the room. 14
Accused-appellant then brought AAA to another room. He asked AAA for her age and further inquired if she was still a virgin. She answered in the affirmative. Accused-appellant then turned off the lights and approached her. He tightly held her upper right arm and kissed her on the lips. While he was taking off her clothes, AAA fearfully pleaded, ""bata pa po ako."" Accused-appellant assured her that she would not get hurt. 15 AAA tried to escape and ran towards the door but accused-appellant grabbed her clothes and forcefully pulled her back. AAA resisted but her efforts proved futile and accused-appellant continued to undress her. After successfully removing all her clothes, accused-appellant laid AAA in bed, kissed her vagina, went on top of her, and inserted his penis into her vagina. Terrified and helpless, AAA could only cry in pain as she pushed accused-appellant away. She tried to stand up but he forcefully tugged her back to bed. That night, accused-appellant ravished her twice. 16 When she went to the restroom, AAA noticed that her vagina was bleeding. She then rushed to BBB in the other room and told the latter, ""Ginalaw ako ni _____."" However, BBB merely brushed it off and told AAA, ""okay lang iyon. Wala lang iyon."" 17
Three days later, or on September 11, 2011, AAA was back at the same hotel with BBB after the latter made her think that they were going somewhere else. There, accused-appellant was already waiting for AAA. BBB then persuaded AAA to go with him, who also promised her that he would give her a mobile phone if she would go to bed with him. Although AAA initially declined the offer, she was nonetheless forced to take drugs and have sex with him. 18
AAA saw accused-appellant a few more times thereafter because BBB would always find a way to persuade her to go back to the hotel with her. On one occasion, accused-appellant told AAA and BBB to bring four other minor females with them so that he could match these girls with four of his male friends. AAA and BBB did as instructed and brought four girls to the hotel. Inside one of the booked rooms, all of them took shabu. Subsequently, accused-appellant provided AAA with her own male customer, whom she had to have sex with. For the sexual service AAA rendered, the customer paid accused-appellant P2,000.00, from which accused-appellant and BBB got P500.00 each, while AAA received the remaining P1,000.00. 19 The same payment and sharing scheme applied to the other girls who accused-appellant paired with the other male customers. 20 On another date, accused-appellant told AAA and BBB to bring three more girls with them. Similar to the previous incident, accused-appellant matched each of them, including AAA, with a male customer. Afterwards, BBB gave AAA her share in the payment for the sexual service she rendered. 21
Later on, accused-appellant and AAA had a misunderstanding and they never saw each other again. 22
On October 11, 2011, AAA's mother, CCC, found out about the ordeal her daughter had suffered in the hands of accused-appellant. AAA told her mother everything — that accused-appellant sexually abused her, pimped her out to several men, and also taught how to use shabu. 23 Thus, AAA and CCC proceeded and reported the matter to the Women's Desk/Inter Agency Anti-Crime Taskforce (IACAT). Subsequently, the police authorities conducted an entrapment operation at ____________ where accused-appellant, together with two other persons, was successfully apprehended. 24
On October 13, 2011, AAA was subjected to a medical examination, which revealed a ""presence of shallow healing laceration at 3 o'clock position, deep healing laceration at 5 o'clock position and deep healed laceration at 7 o'clock position."" 25 It further stated that ""medical evaluation shows a clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma to the hymen."" 26 Moreover, AAA also went through a voluntary drug rehabilitation program, 27 as well as a urinalysis, which showed that she was positive for ""Trichomonas Vaginalis 0-6/hpg,"" a sexually transmitted disease. 28
Version of the Defense:
For his part, accused-appellant vehemently denied the allegations against him. He claimed that he met AAA on October 12, 2011 through BBB and a certain ""Lyn,"" who asked him if he wanted to pay for the sexual services of AAA, since the latter was in need of some money and was willing to be hooked up. 29 Accused-appellant agreed and instructed AAA and BBB to proceed to _______________________. When accused-appellant and his friend, YYY, met the girls, they immediately noticed how young AAA looked. Accused-appellant asked for AAA's true age but BBB assured him and his friend that both she and AAA were already of age. 30 Unconvinced, accused-appellant and YYY decided to call off the arrangement and leave the hotel. 31 However, before they could leave the hotel room, BBB heard a commotion outside. When she opened the door to check what was happening, police officers suddenly barged into the room and immediately ordered them to lie face down on the ground. Thereafter, accused-appellant and YYY were arrested and brought to Camp Bagong Diwa. Accused-appellant was detained for three months while his case was being heard by the prosecutor's office. 32
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:
In a Decision dated June 27, 2016, the RTC acquitted accused-appellant in Criminal Case No. C-87606 for failure of the prosecution to provide sufficient evidence to hold him criminally liable of Qualified Trafficking in Persons with respect to BBB. 33 On the other hand, it found accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. C-87527 for Qualified Trafficking in Persons, and in Criminal Case No. C-87528 for Rape, which were both committed against AAA. The RTC accorded full credence to the testimony of AAA and held that accused-appellant did not only peddle her and offer her services to different men in exchange for money, 34 but that he also had sexual intercourse with AAA against her will and through force and intimidation. 35 The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby renders judgment as follows:
In Criminal Case No. C-87606, for failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused ___________________ of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Person [Section 6 (a) in relation to Section 4 (e), 3 and 10 c of RA 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003) and to Section 5 (a) of RA 8369; Family Courts] he is hereby ordered ACQUITTED of the crime charged;
In Criminal Case No. C-87527, the Court finds the accused _____________ GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Person [Section 6 (a) in relation to Section 4 (e), 3 and 10 c of RA 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003) and to Section 5 (a) of RA 8369; Family Courts] and hereby sentence him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and for him to pay a fine of Two Million pesos (P2,000,000.00); and
In Criminal Case No. C-87528, the Court finds the accused __________________ GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of a crime of Rape defined and penalized under Article 266-A, par. 1 (a) of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 8353 and hereby sentence him to suffer an imprisonment of reclusion perpetua. Further, he is hereby directed to pay the victim the amount of Php100,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php100,000.00 as moral damages and Php100,000.00 as exemplary damages.
Further, as provided by OCA Circular No. 163-2013 (6 December 2013), the immediate commitment and transfer of the accused ________________ to the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila is likewise ordered.
SO ORDERED. 36
Dissatisfied with the ruling of the RTC, accused-appellant appealed 37 to the CA.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
In a Decision dated April 8, 2019, the CA found accused-appellant's appeal unmeritorious and upheld the decision of the RTC. It ruled that the RTC did not err when it convicted accused-appellant of the crimes of Qualified Trafficking in Persons and Rape since the prosecution was able to adequately establish the presence of all the elements of both crimes. 38 Anent the award for damages, the CA deemed it proper to modify the amounts granted by the RTC in order to conform to prevailing jurisprudence. 39 The CA thus ruled:
We MODIFY the Decision dated 27 June 2016 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 130, __________ (""RTC"") as follows:
1. Criminal Case No. C-87527
We find the appellant _________________ GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons, punished under Section 4 (e), in relation to Section 6 (a), Republic Act No. 9208, and sentence the appellant __________________ to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, and to pay the fine of P2,000,000.00, and to pay the victim AAA, the following sums: Php500,000.00 (as moral damages); and Php100,000.00 (as exemplary damages).
All awards for damages shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per year, from the date of finality of this Decision, until fully paid.
2. Criminal Case No. C-87528
We find the appellant ________________ GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the crime of Rape, punished under Article 266-A(1), in relation to Article 266-B, Revised Penal Code, and sentence the appellant ________________ to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, and order him to pay the victim AAA, the following sums: Php75,000.00 (as civil indemnity); Php75,000.00 (as moral damages); and Php75,000.00 (as exemplary damages).
All awards for damages shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per year, from the date of finality of this Decision, until fully paid.
IT IS SO ORDERED. 40
Hence, the present appeal. 41
Issue
The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Qualified Trafficking in Persons and Rape.
Our Ruling
The appeal has no merit. The Court sustains the conviction of accused-appellant for the crimes of Qualified Trafficking in Persons and Rape.
All the elements of Qualified
Trafficking in Persons are
present in the instant case.
In his appellant's brief, accused-appellant contended that he was not the one who recruited AAA. He claimed that he was only a customer and that the person truly responsible for the crime was ""Lyn"" or ""Mommy Lyn,"" who was the handler or pimp of AAA. He also asserted that AAA, having been influenced by BBB, entered into the prostitution trade by her own volition because she needed the money. Consequently, accused-appellant argued that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt and that he should be acquitted. 42
Such contentions are untenable.
Section 3 (a) of RA 9208 defines Trafficking in Persons as ""the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs."" It further states that ""[t]he recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph."" 43
Meanwhile, Section 4 of the same law enumerates the acts that constitute Trafficking in Persons. The portion of Section 4 which is relevant to the case before Us reads:
SEC. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. — It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:
xxx xxx xxx
(e) To maintain or hire a person to engage in prostitution or pornography[.]
Prostitution is specifically defined in the law as ""any act, transaction, scheme or design involving the use of a person by another, for sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct in exchange for money, profit or any other consideration."" 44
In People v. Casio, the Court identified the elements of Trafficking in Persons, as follows:
(1) The act of ""recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders;""
(2) The means used which include ""threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another;"" and
(3) The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ""exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs."" 45
Furthermore, under Section 6 (a), the crime of Trafficking in Persons becomes qualified when the trafficked person is a child, which refers to a person below the age of 18 years old or above 18 years old but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself or herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition. 46
Applying the foregoing law and jurisprudence in the case at bar, the RTC and the CA correctly convicted accused-appellant of Qualified Trafficking in Persons. It was sufficiently proved that all the elements of the crime are present. Through the straightforward and credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, particularly AAA's, it was established that: 1) accused-appellant recruited or hired AAA by instructing her and BBB to bring other minor females at the hotel and introducing them to different customers on separate occasions; (2) accused-appellant took advantage of AAA's vulnerability as a minor child and as someone who was in need of money; and (3) the purpose of such acts was for AAA and the other minor females to engage in sexual intercourse or to render sexual services to several men in exchange for money. Additionally, it is an undisputed fact that AAA was only 14 years old during the time when the incident occurred. Thus, this Court finds that the CA committed no reversible error when it affirmed the RTC's finding that accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons.
Accused-appellant's bare denial that he did not recruit AAA to engage in prostitution must fail in light of the latter's clear, consistent, and credible testimony of AAA. It is an established doctrine that denial is an inherently weak defense and constitutes self-serving negative evidence, which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the positive declaration by a credible witness. Stated otherwise, mere denial, without any strong evidence to support it, cannot overcome the positive declaration by the victim regarding the identity of the accused as well as his involvement in the crime attributed to him. 47
Moreover, the CA correctly held that there is basis to award moral and exemplary damages. Prevailing jurisprudence dictates that ""[t]he criminal case of Trafficking in Persons as a Prostitute is an analogous case to the crimes of seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts. In fact, it is worse, thus, justifying the award of moral damages. Exemplary damages are imposed when the crime is aggravated, as in this case."" 48 Hence, the CA properly awarded moral damages in the amount of P500,000.00 and exemplary damages in the amount P100,000.00 in favor of AAA, plus legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of judgment until full payment. 49
All the elements of Rape are
likewise availing in this case.
Accused-appellant next argued in his appellant's brief that the prosecution failed to prove all the elements of Rape in Criminal Case No. C-87528. He claimed that the presence of force, threat, or intimidation is lacking since AAA disclosed in her sworn statement that she needed money and willingly went with BBB after finding out that the latter earned money by prostituting herself. 50 He also asserted that, ""while AAA admitted that she had sexual intercourse with the accused-appellant, she did not [say] that she was forced, threatened, or intimidated. Besides, the fact that AAA met with the accused-appellant and had sexual intercourse with him more than once . . . is indicative that she did so willingly."" 51
This Court is not persuaded.
Article 266-A of the RPC provides:
ART. 266-A. Rape, When and How Committed. — Rape is committed —
1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
a. Through force, threat or intimidation; x x x
Based on the foregoing provision, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements: (a) that the accused had carnal knowledge of the victim, and (b) that the said act was accomplished through the use of force, threat, or intimidation.
Here, the prosecution sufficiently established that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA on September 8, 2011, through force and intimidation by pulling her and pinning her down, and inserting his penis into her vagina, against her will and without her consent.
AAA clearly and categorically testified that accused-appellant successfully had sexual intercourse with her, despite her struggles and protestations. Her narration revealed the continuous resistance that she put up, and how accused-appellant eventually overpowered her in consummating his bestial desires. It has been repeatedly ruled that, by the peculiar nature of rape cases, conviction thereon most often rests solely on the basis of the offended party's testimony, if credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. 52 We find this doctrine applicable in the case at bar.
It also bears to note at this juncture that, ""generally, whenever there is inconsistency between the affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the testimony commands greater weight considering that affidavits taken ex parte are inferior to testimonies in court, the former being almost invariably incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate, sometimes from partial suggestions and sometimes from want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected circumstances necessary for his accurate recollection of the subject."" 53 Thus, while it was not stated in AAA's sworn statement that she had sexual intercourse with accused-appellant against her will and without her consent, greater weight must be accorded to her testimony in court where she described in full detail how accused-appellant actually forced himself on her.
Further, it is well-settled in this jurisdiction that the assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a domain best left to the trial court judge because of his unique opportunity to observe their deportment and demeanor on the witness stand, a vantage point denied appellate courts; and when his findings have been affirmed by the CA, these are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court. 54
Anent the award of damages, the CA properly modified the amounts imposed from P100,000.00 each for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to P75,000.00 each, being consistent with current jurisprudence. 55
In sum, the Court finds no cogent reason to overturn the findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA. There was no showing that they overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. 56 Thus, accused-appellant's criminal liability for the aforesaid acts must stand.
WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The April 8, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 08573 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant XXX is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of:
(1) Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4 (e) in relation to Section 6 (a) and punished under Section 10 (c) of Republic Act No. 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003. He is SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to PAY a fine of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00). He is further ORDERED to PAY Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) as moral damages and One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) as exemplary damages to AAA;
(2) Rape under Article 266-A and penalized under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code. He is thus SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Further, he is ORDERED to PAY the victim, AAA, the following amounts: (1) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P75,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.
All damages awarded shall be subject to interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction.
SO ORDERED.

PEPE GUMAWID @ KAPPIT, petitioner, vs. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, respondent.
DECISION
INTING, J p:
Before the Court is a Petition for Review 1 on Certiorari assailing the Decision 2 dated November 14, 2018 and the Resolution 3 dated July 9, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 39834. The CA affirmed the Decision 4 dated March 6, 2017 of Branch 52, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Tayug, Pangasinan in Criminal Case No. T-5777 that found Pepe Gumawid @ Kappit (petitioner) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Homicide penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) but acquitted Ronaldo 5 Balingit @ Tonga (Ronaldo), his co-accused, for insufficiency of evidence.
The Antecedents
The case stemmed from an Information that charged petitioner and Ronaldo with Homicide, the accusatory portion of which reads:
""That on or about 10:00 o'clock in the evening of October 23, 2013 at Brgy. Esperanza, [M]unicipality of Umingan, [P]rovince of Pangasinan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, conspiring and helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, held the two hands and stabbed two (2) times one BELLO BUCSIT y JOVES, inflicting upon him two (2) stab wounds on his left chest (Diagnosis: hemorrhagic shock), which caused his instantaneous death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of BELLO BUCSIT y JOVES."" 6 (Italics and emphasis omitted.)
Upon arraignment, both petitioner and Ronaldo pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. 7
Trial ensued.
Version of the Prosecution
The prosecution presented two eyewitnesses: (1) Lydia Bucsit (Lydia), mother of the victim Bello Bucsit (Bello); and (2) Jamaica Bucsit (Jamaica), Bello's daughter. 8
At around 10:00 p.m., Bello, his brother Hayde, and Jamaica attended the wake of one Yolanda Poserio. While thereat, Bello and Hayde played a card game of Lucky 9. After a while, the other players started to accuse Hayde of stealing P300.00 from the money bet; thus, Bello told Hayde that they should go home. When they were about to leave, petitioner punched Bello on his back. At that point, Bello told his daughter Jamaica to leave. Hayde followed Jamaica in going home. 9
Upon reaching home, Jamaica immediately told her grandmother, Lydia, that petitioner and Bello had a fight. After a while, Bello arrived home; but unknown to them, petitioner and Ronaldo followed Bello. From the outside of the house, petitioner shouted: ""Alaek diay suklik (I will get my chan[g]e)."" Petitioner and Ronaldo then started throwing stones at the house which prompted Bello to go outside and hit petitioner with a steel pipe. When petitioner fell, Ronaldo held Bello's hands. At that instance, petitioner stood up and stabbed Bello twice. Bello's family thereafter brought him to the hospital; unfortunately, he eventually died. 10
Bello's family incurred the following expenses for his wake and funeral duly supported by receipts: P25,000.00 for the coffin, P500.00 for the funeral mass, and P20,000.00 for two pigs. 11
Version of the Defense
In their defense, both petitioner and Ronaldo denied the charge against them. According to petitioner, on October 23, 2013, he was attending a wake and betting in a card game of Lucky 9. When he asked for his winnings, someone answered that Bello's brother Hayde took the money. Bello got mad and as a result, petitioner punch Bello. Thereafter, Bello and Hayde went home. After an hour, petitioner and Donato Barnachea (Donato) also went home. While they were passing by Bello's house, Bello appeared and suddenly struck petitioner's nape that caused him to lose consciousness. When he regained his consciousness, he was already on his sister's bamboo bed near the wake. He learned that a certain Macky assisted him in going to his sister's place. 12
Jomel 13 Abalos (Jomel), Donato, and Al Bucsit (Al) corroborated petitioner's testimony.
Jomel testified that Bello struck petitioner with a steel pipe and as a result, petitioner lost consciousness. He stated that neither petitioner nor Hayde stabbed Bello. 14
Al testified that he saw Jomel assist petitioner at the crime scene. When he asked Jomel what happened, the latter replied, ""naulaw ni Manong Cappet, Kagawad"" (Manong Cappet felt dizzy, Kagawad). Then, he proceeded to Bello's house where he saw Bello lying near a coconut tree. He helped bring Bello to the hospital, but the latter was declared dead on arrival. 15
Donato testified that from the wake, he went home together with petitioner. While they passed by the house of Bello, the latter and Hayde went out of their house. Suddenly, Bello hit petitioner with a steel pipe that caused petitioner to fall. Hayde then swung a knife, and thereafter, he heard sounds coming from Bello who was apparently hurt. 16
Ronaldo denied the accusation against him which was corroborated by Mercedes Ortiz (Mercedes). She testified that she was with him at the time of the alleged commission of the crime and that she even instructed him to get the telephone number of the police from her niece. 17
Mary Ann Gumawid also testified that she was just outside her house when she heard someone shout: ""Natayen!"" (Patay na!). She immediately proceeded to the wake where she saw Ronaldo and Mercedes, and informed both of the incident. Mercedes instructed Ronaldo to get the patrol car. 18
The RTC Ruling
In the Decision 19 dated March 6, 2017, the RTC found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Homicide. It sentenced him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal, as maximum. It likewise ordered petitioner to pay Bello's heirs P45,500.00 as compensatory damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages, plus 6% interest per annum on all monetary awards from the finality of the decision until fully paid. However, it acquitted Ronaldo for insufficiency of evidence. 20
The RTC gave credence to the testimonies of Lydia and Jamaica. It held: (1) that the prosecution witnesses' categorical and positive identification prevails over the defenses of denial and alibi; 21 (2) that the prosecution was able to establish that petitioner inflicted two stab wounds on Bello which caused his death; 22 and (3) there was no evidence of Ronaldo's knowledge that petitioner was armed with a knife and that the petitioner had the intention to kill Bello. 23 It ruled that conspiracy between petitioner and Ronaldo was absent because there was no evidence that Ronaldo knew of petitioner's purpose in going to Bello's house. 24
Aggrieved, petitioner appealed to the CA.
The CA Ruling
In the assailed Decision 25 dated November 14, 2018, the CA denied the appeal and affirmed the RTC Decision. 26 It held that: (1) the inconsistencies cited by petitioner in the testimonies of Lydia and Jamaica refer to minor matters which do not affect the latter's credibility as eyewitnesses; 27 (2) whether Hayde or a certain Romy was present during the incident was immaterial to the commission of the crime; 28 and (3) Lydia and Jamaica were certain and straightforward that it was petitioner who stabbed the victim twice, causing the latter's death. 29
Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied it in its Resolution 30 dated July 9, 2019.
Hence, the instant petition.
Petitioner avers that Lydia's testimony that she went outside of their house and saw him stab Bello contradicts Jamaica's statement that Lydia was inside the house when the incident happened. He insists that Lydia could not have possibly seen the stabbing incident. 31 Further, he argues that the statements of the defense witnesses that he lost consciousness when Bello attacked him using a steel pipe are consistent with human nature. Moreover, he concludes that he could not have stabbed Bello as he lost consciousness after Bello hit him with a steel pipe. 32
In the Comment, 33 respondent, through the Office of the Solicitor General, prays that the petition be dismissed for lack of merit. It asserts that: (1) petitioner's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt; 34 (2) the inconsistencies cited by petitioner in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses refer to minor matters which do not affect their credibility as witnesses; 35 and (3) petitioner's defense of denial is weak and self-serving and cannot prevail over the positive declarations of the prosecution witnesses that he killed the victim. 36
The Issue
Whether the CA correctly affirmed petitioner's criminal conviction for Homicide.
Our Ruling
The petition is without merit.
In Estrella v. People, 37 the Court reiterated this well settled rule in jurisdiction, viz.:
The well-settled rule in this jurisdiction is that the matter of ascribing substance to the testimonies of witnesses is best discharged by the trial court, and the appellate courts will not generally disturb the findings of the trial court in this respect. Findings of the trial court which are factual in nature and which involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded with respect, if not finality by the appellate court, when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such findings. The reason is quite simple: the trial judge is in a better position to ascertain the conflicting testimonies of witnesses after having heard them and observed their deportment and mode of testifying during the trial. 38
After a judicious perusal of the records of the instant petition, the Court finds no compelling reason to depart from the uniform factual findings of the RTC and the CA. Thus, the Court affirms petitioner's conviction.
Petitioner was indicted for Homicide under Article 249 of the RPC, as amended, which provides as follows:
Art. 249. Homicide. — Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246, shall kill another without the attendance of any of the circumstances enumerated in the next preceding article, shall be deemed guilty of homicide and be punished by reclusion temporal.
The elements of the crime of Homicide are the following: ""(a) a person was killed; (b) the accused killed him/her without any justifying circumstance; (c) the accused had the intention to kill, which is presumed; and (d) the killing was not attended by any of the qualifying circumstances of murder, or by that of parricide or infanticide."" 39
In the case, the prosecution was able to establish all of the elements specified above: (1) Bello was killed; (2) the prosecution witnesses positively and categorically identified petitioner as the person who stabbed Bello to death; (3) petitioner had the intention to kill Bello, as shown by the fact that after punching the victim at the wake, he followed him to the latter's house, shouted at him, hurled stones at his house, and stabbed him twice on the left chest; 40 (4) the killing was not attended by any qualifying circumstances of murder, parricide, or infanticide.

an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which shall be that which, in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed under the rules of the said Code, and to a minimum which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense. 53
Moreover, paragraph 1, Article 64 of the RPC provides:
ART. 64. Rules for the application of penalties which contain three periods. — In cases in which the penalties prescribed by law contain three periods, whether it be a single divisible penalty or composed of three different penalties, each one of which forms a period in accordance with the provisions of Articles 76 and 77, the courts shall observe for the application of the penalty the following rules, according to whether there are or are not mitigating or aggravating circumstances:
1. When there are neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances, they shall impose the penalty prescribed by law in its medium period. (Italics supplied.)
One degree lower than reclusion temporal is prision mayor which has a medium period of eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years. On the other hand, the medium period of reclusion temporal is fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months.
Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law and there being no modifying circumstance, it is proper to sentence petitioner to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for the indeterminate period of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum. 54
Finally, the Court finds that the amounts awarded are in conformity with jurisprudence. 55 The RTC correctly awarded P45,500.00 as compensatory damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages. All damages awarded to the heirs of the victim should earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment. 56
WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 14, 2018 and the Resolution dated July 9, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 39834 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that petitioner Pepe Gumawid @ Kappit is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum; and he is ORDERED to pay the heirs of Bello Bucsit y Joves the following amounts: P45,500.00 as compensatory damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages. All the damages awarded shall earn legal interest rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this decision until fully paid.
SO ORDERED.

HEIRS OF HERMINIO MARQUEZ, represented by ALMA MARIE MARQUEZ, petitioners, vs. HEIRS OF EPIFANIA M. HERNANDEZ, represented by LOURDES H. TIONSON, * respondents.
DECISION
HERNANDO, *** J p:
Before the Court is a petition for review on certiorari 1 filed by petitioners Heirs of Herminio Marquez, represented by Alma Marie Marquez (Marquez), seeking to reverse and set aside the September 22, 2017 Decision 2 and January 19, 2018 Resolution 3 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 107241, which affirmed with modifications the January 28, 2016 Decision 4 and June 14, 2016 Resolution 5 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 10, Malolos City, Bulacan, in Civil Case No. 780-M-2000.
The Factual Antecedents:
As narrated by the CA in the assailed Decision and based on the records of the case, the essential facts and antecedent proceedings of the case are as follows:
The instant case stemmed from a complaint 6 for specific performance with damages filed by herein respondents Heirs of Epifania M. Hernandez; namely, Lourdes Hernandez-Tiongson, Hernando H. Hernandez, Gliceria Hernandez-De Dios, Remedios Hernandez-Castro, Dionisia Hernandez-Panopio, Aurora Hernandez-Pascual, and Oscar M. Hernandez (collectively, respondents), on November 21, 2000 against Herminio Marquez (Herminio). In their amended complaint, 7 respondents impleaded herein petitioner Marquez.
Respondents are the children and legal heirs of Epifania Hernandez (Epifania). Since 1955, respondents and Epifania have been occupying a parcel of land located in Matungao, Bulacan with an area of 200 square meters (subject property). The subject property forms part of a 1,417-square meter property previously owned by the spouses Anastacio and Lourdes Sakay (spouses Sakay), and spouses Godofredo and Florsita Cruz (spouses Cruz). Epifania and respondents had built their house on the subject property with the consent and tolerance of its previous owners. 8
In 1967, the spouses Sakay and the spouses Cruz sold the 1,417-square meter property to Herminio. 9 CAacTH
In 1985, Herminio sold to Epifania the 200-square meter portion of the land or which her house was built for P400.00 per square meter. In view of this sale agreement, Epifania supposedly undertook to pay Herminio the total price of the subject property within the year of its purchase, or sometime before the end of 1985. In the event that Epifania failed to comply with the terms, the sale agreement would be considered or treated as a lease contract, and the amounts paid by Epifania would be treated as rentals or advances to Herminio under a continuing lease of the subject property. 10
Epifania made an initial payment to Herminio in the amount of P2,000.00 as evidenced by a provisional receipt 11 dated October 23, 1985 signed by Herminio, which states:
Tinanggap ko kay Gng. Epifania M. Hernandez ang halagang (P2,000) dalawang libong piso bilang paunang bayad sa loteng kanyang kinatatayuan, ngayong 23 October 1985 (Ang bawat metro ay P400). 12
Epifania then made payment by way of installment to Herminio by depositing certain amounts of money in a joint account between them with the Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc. Epifania also paid Herminio through various Metrobank Checks all of which were in the amounts of P500.00 each. 13 According to respondents, Epifania was able to pay in full the agreed purchase for the subject property before her death on July 28, 1995.
Sometime in March 2000, respondents executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of the Heirs of Epifania Hernandez 14 which stated, in part, that the proceeds of the joint savings account of their mother and Herminio with the Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc. shall be considered as full payment for the subject property. Notably, Herminio signified his conformity to the above-quoted provision in the said extrajudicial settlement between respondents by affixing his signature thereon. 15
Subsequently, the Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc. ceased operations. After processing the deposit insurance claim with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), a check in the amount of P61,429.87 was released by PDIC, which was received by Herminio on June 16, 2000. 16
Meanwhile, on December 15, 1999 17 and July 17, 2000, 18 respondents received from Marquez demand letters to vacate the premises of the subject property. It appears that on August 4, 1994, Marquez and Herminio executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights 19 whereby Herminio waived all his rights, interest and participation over the 1,417-square meter property in favor of Marquez.
Despite respondents' demands, Herminio allegedly refused to execute a deed of absolute sale over the subject property in favor of Epifania. Thus, respondents' complaint for specific performance against Herminio.
Marquez, being the registered owner of the 1,417-square meter property, which is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) T-81516, 20 respondents filed an amended complaint 21 impleading Marquez as a defendant. In the said amended complaint, respondents prayed that judgment be rendered directing Herminio and Marquez to cause the execution of a deed of absolute sale for the subject property in favor of respondents and that title over the subject property be transferred to their names.
In his answer, 22 Herminio argued that when Epifania reneged on her obligation complete payment of the purchase price in 1985, their initial agreement became one of lease, and not a contract of sale. He also averred that he is not the real-party in interest as the title over the 1,417-square meter property was already transferred to Marquez as early as 1996.
Marquez for her part, alleged in her answer 23 that Epifania did not make any subsequent payments after her initial payment of P2,000.00 to Herminio. Moreover, all amounts accepted by Herminio from Epifania are considered as rental payments for the use and occupancy of the subject property.
Meanwhile, Herminio died and was substituted by his heir, herein petitioner.
Ruling of the Region of Trial Court:
After trial on the merits, the RTC, on January 28, 2016, rendered a Decision 24 in favor of respondents declaring as valid the sale between Herminio and Epifania, and directing Marquez to cause the partition of the 1,417-square meter property described and covered under TCT No. T-81516 so as to give full effect of the contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania. The RTC also directed the Register of Deeds of Guiguinto, Bulacan, after the said partition, to cause the cancellation of TCT No. T-81516, and issue separate titles in the names of Epifania and Marquez which should reflect their respective shares in the 1,417-square meter. The dispositive portion of the said Decision states:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is rendered in favor of the herein plaintiffs and against the defendant in his wise:
(i) Affirming as valid the contract of sale between Herminio Marquez and Epifania Hernandez affecting the portion of the parcel of land where the house of said Epifania Hernandez stands, specifically the 190 square meters portion thereof, more or less, which is now covered by Transfer Certificate of Titel n No. T-81516, now registered in the name of defendant Alma Marie Marquez;
(2) Directing the parties herein, especially defendant Alma Marie Marquez, to cause the partition of the parcel of land particularly described and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-81516 to give full effect to the contract of sale between Herminio Marquez and Epifania Hernandez;
(3) Directing the Register of Deeds of Guiguinto, Bulacan, after the said partition, to cause the cancellation of TCT No. T-81516 and in lieu thereof, to issue separate titles in the name of Epifania Hernandez and Alma Marie Marquez, each reflecting their respective shares in the subject property;
(4) Directing defendants Alma Marie Marquez to pay plaintiffs herein the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) as and by way of attorney's fees. CTIEac
No pronouncements as to costs.
SO ORDERED. 25
In so ruling, the RTC explained that the contract of sale between Epifania and Herminio was consummated when the latter accepted from the former the initial payment of P2,000.00. Moreover, when Herminio allowed Epifania and her children to occupy the subject property, it was from this point when ownership thereof was transferred from Herminio to Epifania. 26
The RTC also disregarded the contention of Marquez that the proceeds of joint account between Herminio and Epifania with Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc., which Herminio received are considered rental payments of Epifania for the use and occupancy of the subject property. In this regard, the RTC emphasized that consider such payment as lease rentals would totally disregard the already consummated contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania. The RTC also explained that even if Epifanio failed to pay the whole purchase price in 1985, is does not make inoperative the contract of sale nor convert the same into a contract of lease between the parties. 27
The RTC also held at even if Herminio alienated a portion of the 1,417-square meter property without the consent of Marquez as a co-owner, this does not invalidate the sale since what is affected by the sale is only the proportionate share of Herminio. 28
Anent Marquez's contention that respondents are guilty of laches and estoppel, or that the action already prescribed when they failed to seasonably file the instant complaint against Herminio, the RTC held that since the amended complaint is one for quieting of title, the same does not prescribe against Epifania and her heirs who were in possession of the subject property.
Marquez filed a motion for reconsideration 29 of the said January 28, 2016 Decision but the same was denied by the RTC in a Resolution 30 dated June 14, 2016.
Aggrieved, Marquez appealed 31 before the CA.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
In the assailed Decision, 32 the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit. The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, the trial court's Decision dated January 28, 2016 and Resolution dated June 14, 2016 are affirmed, subject to the modification that the following paragraphs (2) and (3) of the dispositive portion of the Decision are hereby deleted:
""(2) Directing the parties herein, especially defendant Alma Marie Marquez, to cause the partition of the parcel of land particularly described and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-81516 to give full effect to the contract of sale between Herminio Marquez and Epifania Hernandez;
(3) Directing the Register of Deeds of Guiguinto, Bulacan, after the said partition, to cause the cancellation of TCT No. T-81516 and in lieu thereof, to issue separate titles in the name of Epifania Hernandez and Alma Marie Marquez, each reflecting their respective shares in the subject property"";
SO ORDERED. 33
The CA affirmed the findings of the RTC that the complaint filed by respondents is not for specific performance but one for quieting of title. The CA held that the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights executed by Herminio in favor of Marquez had the effect of casting a cloud on respondents' equitable title over the subject property. SaCIDT
The CA also held that respondents are not guilty of laches since their continuous and actual possession of the subject property have rendered their right to bring an action for quieting of title imprescriptible.
The CA also affirmed the findings of the RTC that a perfected contract of sale existed between Herminio and Epifania. The CA, however, held that the RTC had no jurisdiction to order the partition of the 1,417-square meter property between Epifania and Marquez since partition of real property is a special proceeding and not an ordinary civil action.
Aggrieved, Marquez moved for reconsideration, 34 which was, however, denied in a Resolution 35 dated January 19, 2018. Hence, this petition.
Issue
In the petition, 36 Marquez raised the following assignment of errors:
I.
JURISDICTION IS CONFERRED BASED ON THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT. HENCE, THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT ALLOWED THE CONVERSION OF AN ACTION FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE TO QUIETING OF TITLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO ALLEGATION THAT WILL WARRANT QUIETING OF TITLE.
II.
ACTION PRESCRIBES IN TEN YEARS HENCE, THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT ALLOWED THE COMPLAINT TO BE GIVEN DUE COURSE DESPITE THE FACT THAT ELEVEN YEARS HAD LAPSED AND NO ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST THE APPELLANT.
III.
THE CONVERSION OF THE CASE OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE TO QUIETING OF TITLE IS A COLLATERAL ATTACK ON THE TITLE. HENCE, THE LOWER COURT ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT DECLARED AS VALID THE CONTRACT OF SALE AND DIRECTED APPELLANT TO CAUSE THE PARTITION OF THE TITLE.
IV.
THERE IS NO CONTRACT OF SALE BECAUSE THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS ARE NOT PRESENT. HENCE, THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT DISREGARDED THAT SALE OF REAL PROPERTIES MUST BE IN WRITING AND IN A PUBLIC INSTRUMENT. 37
In a Memorandum 38 filed with this Court, Marquez raised the following issues:
I.
WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE RULING OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT THAT THERE WAS A CONTRACT OF SALE BETWEEN EPIFANIA HERNANDEZ AND HERMINIO MARQUEZ OVER THE 200 SQUARE METER PORTION OF THE PROPERTY COVERED BY TRANSFER CERTIFICATE TITLE NO. T-81516.
II.
WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE RULING OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT THAT THE ACTION FILED BY RESPONDENTS HEIRS OF HERNANDEZ IS ONE FOR QUIETING OF TITLE. cHECAS
III.
WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE RULING OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT THAT THE ACTION FILED BY RESPONDENTS HEIRS OF HERNANDEZ IS NOT BARRED BY LACHES. 39
Marquez maintains that no valid contract existed between Epifania and Herminio because at the time that Herminio sold the subject property to Epifania in 1985, the whole 1,417-square meter property (within which the subject property lies) was co-owned by Herminio and Marquez. Relying on Cabrera v. Ysaac 40 (Cabrera) Marquez argues that since Herminio failed to obtain her consent, as a co-owner of the 1,417-square meter property, to the sale of the subject property to Epifania, the sale agreement is considered void, and thus, cannot bind her as the property's current registered owner.
Marquez further argues that the evidence on record shows that she and Herminio did not give their consent to the sale of the subject property and its purchase price, which would have constituted the contract of sale.
There being no valid contract of sale, Marquez concludes that the continued occupation of Epifania and respondents of the subject property created a forced lease, which thus warranted the payment of rental fees. In this regard, all payments received by Herminio from Epifania are considered rental payments for the use and occupancy of the subject property.
Marquez also maintains that the CA erred in affirming the finding of the RTC that the complaint filed by respondents is one for quieting of title, and that the complaint filed by respondents is not barred by prescription and laches.
Our Ruling
The Court resolves to deny the petition.
An examination of the issues raised by Marquez in her petition including her memorandum readily reveals that the same are a mere rehash of the basic issues raised before the RTC and the CA, and which were already exhaustively passed upon and duly resolved by the lower courts. Moreover, this Court observes that Marquez failed to show that the factual findings of the RTC and the CA were not supported by evidence, or that their decisions were contrary to applicable law and jurisprudence.
Marquez also raises various factual issues which require a review of the evidence on record. These are clearly beyond the Court's jurisdiction under the present petition. On this point, it bears stressing that ""this Court not a trier of facts, and it is not its function to re-examine and weigh anew the respective evidence of the parties,"" 41 more so in this case where the findings of the RTC coincide with those of the CA.
There was a valid contract of sale
between Herminio and Epifania.
At any rate, this Court is in accord with the findings of the RTC and CA that there exists a perfected contract of sale between Epifanio and Herminio based on the following pieces of evidence:
First, the October 23, 1985 provisional receipt signed by Herminio wherein he stated that he acknowledged receipt from Epifania Hernandez the amount of P2,000.00 as initial payment for the subject property; second, the checks issued to Herminio as partial payments for to subject property; third, the acknowledgment receipt dated July 16, 2000 from the PDIC stating that Herminio received from the PDIC a Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) Check No. 97969 in the amount of P61,429.87 as payment of insured deposit from his Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc. joint savings account with Epifania; and fourth, the Extra-Judicial Settlement of the Heirs of Epifania stating that the proceeds of the joint savings account served as full payment from Epifania of the subject property, which was conformed to and signed by Herminio. AHDacC
Notably, respondents have been consistent in raising the aforementioned factual evidence before the RTC and the CA. They also maintained the theory that Herminio sold the subject property to Epifania, and that their mother paid the purchase price in full before her death in 1995. In fact, there is evidence to prove the existence of the sale agreement between Herminio and Epifania by virtue of the Extra-Judicial Settlement of the Heirs of Epifania Hernandez, which, as stated above, was signed by and conformed to by Herminio. The pertinent portions of the said documents read:
3. The said deceased (Epifania Hernandez), at the time of her death, left a joint savings account with the Rural Bank of Del Pilar, Inc. with business address in Bulacan, Bulacan in the amount of fifty-six thousand eight hundred twenty-nine pesos and ninety-five centavos (Php56,829.95), Philippine currency, under Savings Account No. SA-14082. Her co-depositor is Herminio Marquez;
4. The proceeds of said joint savings account is full payment for the land bought by our mother from Herminio Marquez. This arrangement was agreed upon by our mother and said Herminio Marquez during the former's lifetime. Said land is located in Matunago, Bulacan, Bulacan. 42
Marquez, on the other hand, failed to question the document's authenticity, including the contents thereof and due execution. The Court is thus inclined to, as it does, give credence to respondents' assertion that a sale agreement was entered into by Herminio and Epifania involving the subject property.
Taking all the pieces of evidence together, there is no doubt that both Herminio and Epifania intended to, and did in fact, enter into a contract of sale of the subject property.
We also agree with the findings of the RTC that the contract of sale was consummated ever before Epifania made full payment of the purchase price, and that Herminio transferred ownership over the said property when he allowed Epifania and respondents to continue their occupation thereon consequent to the execution of the agreement. In this regard, the RTC held, to wit:
In the case at bar, the parties' contract was consummated when Herminio accepted the initial payment of P2,000.00 from Epifania on October 23, 1985. Too, Herminio transferred his ownership over the questioned portion of the property when he allowed Epifania and her heirs to continue their occupation thereof consequent to their agreement. Ownership of the thing sold shall be transferred to the vendee upon the actual or constructive delivery thereof. The thing is understood as delivered when it is placed in the control and possession of the vendee. Ergo, and even assuming, for the sake of argument that there is no full satisfaction of the stipulated purchase price, the actual turn-over of the possession of the property renders the contract consummated, albeit partially. This is true since the payment of the purchase price is not essential to the transfer of ownership as long as the property sold has been delivered; and such delivery (traditio) operated to divest the vendor of title to the property which may not be regained or recovered until and unless the contract is resolved or rescinded in accordance with law.
Consequently, when Herminio allowed Epifania to occupy the subject property, he voluntarily relinquished whatever claim he has over the real property, particularly over the piece of land where Epifania built her house. It was from that point when the ownership over the subject property was transferred from Herminio to Epifania. This is notwithstanding that he only received a partial payment of P2,000.00 from Epifania that time since it is the operative act of ""delivery"" which gives rise to the conveyance of ownership over an immovable property. 43 IDSEAH
Marquez argues that the sale agreement is void since, at the time the same was executed, Herminio failed to obtain her consent as co-owner of the property.
We find this argument untenable. This Court is aware of its pronouncement in Cabrera 44 that ""[a] contract of sale which purports to sell a specific or definite portion of unpartitioned land is null and void ab initio."" 45 Cabrera involved a sale of a parcel of land between plaintiff and defendant, which at that time, was still held in common by fourteen (14) other individuals, including defendant therein as evidenced by the original certificate of title. Notably, despite the existence of the sale involving the said parcel of land, the plaintiff failed to present evidence that the defendant was authorized by his co-owners to sell the land. Thus, the Court ruled in this case that without the consent of his co-owners, defendant could not sell a definite portion of the co-owned property.
The Court's pronouncement in Cabrera is instructive on this point, to wit:
The undivided interest of a co-owner is also referred to as the ""ideal or abstract quota"" or ""proportionate share."" On the other hand, the definite portion of the land refers to specific metes and bounds of a co-owned property.
To illustrate, if a ten-hectare property is owned equally by ten co-owners, the undivided interest of a co-owner is one hectare. The definite portion of that interest is usually determined during judicial or extrajudicial partition. After partition, a definite portion of the property held in common is allocated to a specific co-owner. The co-ownership is dissolved and, in effect, each of the former co-owners is free to exercise autonomously the rights attached to his or her ownership over the definite portion of the land. It is crucial that the co-owners agree to which portion of the land goes to whom.
Hence, prior to partition, a sale of a definite portion of common property requires the consent of all co-owners because it operates to partition the land with respect to the co-owner selling his or her share. The co-owner or seller is already marking which portion should redound to his or her autonomous ownership upon future partition. 46
In other words, a co-owner cannot sell a definite portion of a land without the consent from his or her co-owners. This is based on the principle that a sale of a portion of the property is considered an alteration of the thing owned in common, and, therefore, requires the unanimous consent of the other co-owners. 47 Of course, the law allows co-owner to alienate an undivided interest of the co-owned property. 48
Marquez points out that the contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania involved a definite portion of the 1,417-square meter property owned in common by Herminio and Marquez. Applying the Court's pronouncement in Cabrera, it would seem that the contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania is void and deemed legally inexistent.
The ruling in Cabrera, however, does not apply to Marquez.
First, unlike in Cabrera, no evidence was adduced during trial to show that Marquez had no knowledge of, or disapproved the sale of the subject property to Epifania and respondents. In fact, all throughout the proceedings before the RTC and CA, Marquez made it known that she is aware that Epifania and respondents were occupying the subject property, and the existence of a sale agreement between Herminio and Epifania involving the said property. It even appears from the records that Marquez tolerated respondents' possession and occupation of the subject property. In fact, despite her knowledge of the said sale agreement, it was only on July 17, 2900, or 15 years after the same was executed in 1985, that Marquez demanded respondents to vacate the proper. 49 aCIHcD
Second, the parcel of land in Cabrera, on one hand, was held in common by various owners at the time the sale agreement was entered into by the plaintiff and respondent as evidenced by the original certificate of title covering the said property. On the other hand, in the instant case, the only evidence of co-ownership presented by Marquez is the Extra-Judicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights 50 executed by and between Herminio and Marquez on August 4, 1994, or nine years after the contract of sale was entered into by Herminio and Epifania.
Even if the 1,417-square meter property was owned in common by Herminio and Marquez, We hold that the sale of a definite Portion thereof by Herminio to Epifania is entirely valid. This is because the Moment Herminio pointed out the boundaries of the subject property, and Marquez made no objection thereto, there is, in effect a partial partition of the co-owned property. Accordingly, the sale of a definite portion thereof can no longer be questioned or assailed by Marquez. Our pronouncement in Pamplona v. Moreto 51 is instructive on this point, to wit:
The title may be pro-indiviso or inchoate but the moment the co-owner as vendor pointed out its location and even indicated the boundaries over which the fences were to be erected without objection, protest or complaint by the other co-owners, on the contrary they acquiesced and tolerated such alienation, occupation and possession, We rule that a factual partition or termination of the co-ownership, although partial, was created, and barred not only the vendor, Flaviano Moreto, but also his heirs, the private respondents herein from asserting as against the vendees-petitioners any right or title in derogation of the deed of sale executed by said vendor Flaviano Moreto. 52
It bears emphasis that Marquez does not, in fact, deny the existence of the contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania involving the subject property. Marquez has consistently argued before the RTC and CA that although a sale agreement existed between Herminio and Epifania, the sale between them was not consummated for failure on the part of Epifania to pay Herminio the purchase price in full before the end of 1985. In this regard, even if we suppose for the sake of argument that Epifania was in delay, or even defaulted in her contractual obligations, this does not denote that no contract of sale existed between the parties. To reiterate, ownership over the subject property was transferred from Herminio to Epifania in 1995. It was at this point that the sale between the parties was consummated. Accordingly, Herminio cannot unilaterally rescind or cancel the agreement, nor convert the same into a contract of lease by simply asserting it to be so. Nor can he unilaterally reclaim the property by merely asserting non-payment of the purchase price on the part of Epifania. It bears emphasis that non-payment of the purchase price of the subject property does not ipso facto nullify the contract of sale between the parties. In any event, the Court finds that the contract of sale was fully consummated when Herminio received from the PDIC the insured deposit in the amount of P61,429.87.
With the foregoing, there was concededly a consummated contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania involving the subject property. It follows, therefore, that when Herminio bequeathed his interest over the 1,417-square meter property in favor of Marquez by virtue of the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights, it is deemed to have excluded the portion of the property already sold by Herminio to Epifania.
Respondents' complaint is not
only for specific performance but
also for quieting of title.
""The nature of an action is determined by the material allegations of the complaint and the character of the relief sought by plaintiff, and the law in effect when the action was filed irrespective of whether he is entitled to all or only some of such relief."" 53 Accordingly, the allegations in the amended complaint of respondents readily show that the complaint was not only for specific performance, but also for quieting of title. In this regard, for an action to quiet to prosper, two indispensable requisites must concur, namely: ""(1) the plaintiff or complainant has a legal or an equitable title to or interest in the real property subject of the action; and (2) the deed, claim, encumbrance, or proceeding claimed to be casting cloud on his[/her] title must be shown to be in fact invalid or inoperative despite its prima facie appearance of validity or legal efficacy."" 54 cHaCAS
In the instant case, ownership over the subject property was transferred to Epifania as early as 1985 by virtue of its delivery by Herminio. Respondents, as heirs of Epifania, thus acquired an equitable title to the subject property. However, the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights presented by Marquez, which resulted in the issuance of TCT No. T-81516 in the latter's name, was casting a cloud on the said equitable title of respondents over the said property. It is for this reason that respondents filed the present action against petitioner to, once and for all, remove such cloud or to quiet the title.
Accordingly, it cannot be said that respondents are guilty of laches since their continuous actual possession of the subject property has rendered their right to bring an action for quieting of title imprescriptible. Moreover, it bears noting that Marquez's demand letters 55 to respondents to vacate the subject property were dated December 15, 1999 and July 17, 2000. Thus, it was only during these instances that respondents came to know that Marquez was claiming ownership over the property. Respondents then filed their complaint on November 21, 2000, while their amended complaint was filed on December 14, 2001. Clearly, laches has not yet set in against respondents. As correctly observed by the RTC:
In catena of cases, it has been held that an action for quieting of title does not prescribe against the person in actual possession of the disputed property.
xxx xxx xxx
It was only on December 15, 1999, when plaintiffs received defendant Alma Marie's demand letter to vacate the premises. It was from that point when plaintiffs became aware of defendants' adverse claim of ownership over the entire subject parcel of land including the specific portion that they already own. Hence, from 1985 until 1999, plaintiffs have been in peaceful possession of the subject portion of the property and have the right to presume that everything is in order. Plaintiffs' right was ""disturbed"" only when the defendant demanded recovery of the possession of the property. The present action was filed on November 2000, or barely a year after plaintiffs received Alma Marie's demand letter.
Certainly, the present suit is one for quieting of title and thus, imprescriptible. Too, plaintiffs are not guilty of laches or estoppel considering that they instituted the present action immediately upon receipt of the knowledge of Alma Marie's claim over the subject premises. 56
Other matters:
Marquez believes that an action for quieting of title which involves a challenge to the validity of TCT No. T-81516 is a collateral attack to a certificate of title, which is prohibited by law.
An action is deemed an attack on a title ""when the object of the action or proceeding is to nullify the title, and thus challenge the judgment pursuant to which the title was decreed. The attacks direct when the object of an action or proceeding is to annul or set aside such judgment, or enjoin its enforcement. On the other hand, the attack is indirect or collateral when, in an action to obtain a different relief, an attack on the judgment is nevertheless made as an incident thereof."" 57
To be clear, what cannot be collaterally attacked is the certificate of title, and not the title itself. 58 The Certificate referred to is the document issued by the Register of Deeds known as the Transfer Certificate of Title or TCT. In contrast, the title referred to by law means ownership, which is represented by that document. Title as a concept of ownership should not be confused with the certificate of title evidencing such ownership. 59 In this case, what respondents are assailing is Marquez's claim of ownership over the subject property. In any event, placing a land under the Torrens system does not mean that ownership thereof can no longer be attacked or disputed. A certificate cannot always be considered as conclusive evidence of ownership. 60 DACcIH
Even on the premise that respondents seek to invalidate TCT No. T-81516 in an action for quieting of title, said action is, in fact, not a collateral attack but a direct attack thereto since it is essential in such action that respondents show the invalidity of the deed which casts a cloud on their title over the subject property. 61 In other words, a complaint for quieting of title does not amount to a collateral attack because at the heart of the action for quieting of title is the adjudication of the ownership of the disputed property and the consequent nullification of the questioned certificates of title, if so warranted by the circumstances of the case. 62
We do not agree, however, with the pronouncement of the CA that the RTC had no jurisdiction to order the partition of the 1,417-square meter property because partition of real property is a special proceeding which cannot be a subject of an ordinary civil action for quieting of title.
It bears noting that in its January 28, 2016 Decision, the RTC ordered the Register of Deeds to cause the cancellation of TCT No. T-81516 and issue separate titles in the name of Epifania and Marquez, each reflecting their respective shares in the 1,417-square meter property. In this regard, this Court is aware that it is improper for the RTC to order a partition of an estate in an action for quieting of title. This holds true when the co-owned property itself has not been judicially or extrajudicially partitioned by its co-owners. 63
However, in the instant case, as discussed move, there was already a prior partial partition of the 1,417-square meter property when at the time of the sale, Herminio pointed out the area and location of the 200 square meters portion sold by him to Epifania on which her house stands. This partition of the co-owned property, although partial, was created and later embodied in the Extra-Judicial Settlement of the Heirs of Epifania Hernandez. The RTC, therefore, did not err in issuing the abovementioned directives to the Register of Deeds as it merely upheld contract of sale between Herminio and Epifania, and reiterated the constituted partial partition of the 1,417-square meter property embodied in the Extra-Judicial Settlement of the Heirs of Epifania Hernandez. 64
Moreover, it bears emphasizing that the essential facts of the case for the determination of ownership and the title's validity are new before this Court. Thus, to require the parties in this case to institute separate partition and/or cancellation proceedings would be unnecessarily circuitous and against the interest of justice. 65
Accordingly, well-settled is the rule that ""one of the purposes for which courts are organized is to put an end to controversy in the determination of the respective rights of the contending parties. With the full knowledge that courts are not infallible, the litigants submit their respective claims for judgment, and they have a right at some time or another to have final judgment on which they can rely over a final disposition of the issue or issues submitted, and to know that there is an end to the litigation; otherwise, there would be no end to legal processes."" 66
WHEREFORE, the petition for review on certiorari is hereby DENIED. The September 22, 2017 Decision and January 19, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 107241 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS, as follows:
(1) Affirming as valid the contract of sale between Herminio Marquez and Epifania Hernandez affecting the portion of the parcel of land where the house of said Epifania Hernandez stands, specifically the 190-square-meter portion thereof, more or less, which is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-81516, now registered in the name of petitioner Alma Marie Marquez;
(2) Directing the parties herein, especially petitioner Alma Marie Marquez, to cause the partition of the parcel of land particularly described and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-81516 to give full effect to the contract of sale between Herminio Marquez and Epifania Hernandez; HSCATc

(4) Directing petitioner Alma Marie Marquez to pay respondents herein the amount of P20,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees.

[G.R. No. 230597. March 23, 2022.]
ARIEL M. REYES, petitioner, vs. RURAL BANK OF SAN RAFAEL (BULACAN), INC., FLORANTE VENERACION, CELERINA SABARIAGA, ALICIA FLOR KABILING, FIDELA MANAGO, CEFERINO DE GUZMAN, and RIZALINO QUINTOS, respondents.
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 assailing the July 22, 2016 Decision 2 and March 8, 2017 Resolution 3 both issued by the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA Decision affirmed the September 30, 2014 Decision 4 issued by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), denying petitioner Ariel M. Reyes' (Reyes) appeal, and reversing the February 24, 2014 Labor Arbiter's Decision, 5 which found him illegally dismissed and entitled to money claims. Meanwhile, the CA Resolution denied Reyes' Motion for Reconsideration.
The Factual Antecedents:
Respondent Rural Bank of San Rafael (Bulacan), Inc. (RBSR) is a domestic banking corporation while respondents Florante Veneracion (Veneracion), Celerina Sabariaga (Sabariaga), Alicia Flor Kabiling (Kabiling), Fidela Manago (Manago), Ceferino De Guzman (De Guzman), and Rizalino Quintos (Quintos) (collectively, respondents), are members of RBSR's Board of Directors.
Sometime in 2012, several stockholders of RBSR complained about the discrepancies in the amounts of the purchase price of stock subscriptions appearing in the original receipts as against the duplicate copies issued by the bank. The anomaly involved several millions of pesos collected from stockholders of RBSR which, if not corrected, will certainly tarnish the image and integrity of the latter.
Acting on this anomaly, RBSR conducted an investigation and confirmed the irregularities. It was discovered that in the original receipts given to the stockholders, the stated price of shares ranged from P250.00 to P275.00, but in the duplicate copies retained by RBSR, only P100.00 was indicated. Moreover, the original receipts were signed by Flordeliza Cruz, then President of RBSR, while the duplicate copies were signed either by its then Treasury Head Emilline C. Bognot (Bognot), or Branch Manager Reynaldo Eusebio, Jr. (Eusebio).
Thus, in compliance with the Manual of Regulations for Banks mandating the prompt report of anomalies to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), RBSR's Board of Directors approved a Report on Crimes and Losses and directed Reyes — as Compliance Officer — to certify the same. However, Reyes refused to certify the report, reasoning that no independent investigation was conducted, and that he cannot completely validate the same for lack of material data and evidence, and that he was being pressured to certify the report. CAIHTE
Thereafter, Reyes claimed that instead of furnishing him the hard copies of the reports and its original attachments to enable him to verify and certify the same, RBSR issued him two show cause orders and put him on preventive suspension for neglect of duty. Meanwhile, RBSR contended that several administrative hearings were scheduled to hear Reyes' side, but all were ignored.
On March 25, 2013, Reyes, together with Bognot and Eusebio (complainants) — who were principally accused of theft/misappropriation of funds in connection with the anomaly — filed a Complaint 6 against respondents for illegal suspension and money claims. An Amended Complaint 7 was subsequently filed to include illegal dismissal, in view of their eventual dismissal from work.
Ruling of the Labor Arbiter:
In a Decision 8 dated February 24, 2014, Labor Arbiter Reynaldo V. Abdon found RBSR guilty of illegally dismissing Reyes, Bognot, and Eusebio. The arbiter's ruling was mainly based on RBSR's failure to file its Position Paper and submit its evidence during the proceedings, which constrained the arbiter to rule on the matter based solely on the complainants' evidence.
Based on the complainants' evidence and submissions, the arbiter found that complainants' dismissal was without a valid cause, and that they were denied due process for having been summarily dismissed. Further, it is incumbent upon the employer to show proof that the employee was dismissed for a just or authorized cause, which the bank failed to establish since it did not file its Position Paper and submit its evidence.
The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby declared that complainants were illegally terminated by respondents. Consequently, respondent Rural Bank of San Rafael Bulacan and individual respondents Florante Veneracion, Celerina Sabariaga, Alicia Flor C. Kabiling, Fidela Manago, Fabian Cordero, Ceferino De Guzman and Rizalino Quintos III are jointly and severally DIRECTED to PAY complainants to (sic) their backwages and separation pay, accrued leave benefits and proportionate 13th month pay as follows:
  Name
Backwages
Separation Pay
13th Month Pay
Ariel M. Reyes
P399,960.00
P180,000.00
P8,400.00
Emilline C. Bognot
333,300.00
150,000.00
7,000.00
Reynaldo M. Eusebio Jr.
447,055.29
442,629.00
9,389.10
  Additionally, respondents are ordered to pay complainants' attorney's fee in the sum of P197,773.33.
Other claims are denied for lack of basis.
SO ORDERED. 9
Thus, respondents elevated the case to the NLRC.
Ruling of the National Labor
Relations Commission:
In its Decision 10 promulgated on September 30, 2014, the NLRC reversed the arbiter's ruling. Notably, the NLRC applied a liberal interpretation and relaxed procedural rules, and held that substantial justice must prevail over technicalities. Thus, the NLRC allowed respondents to submit countervailing evidence even on appeal.
On the substantial issue, the NLRC found that complainants were not illegally dismissed. Respondents were able to discharge the burden of proving that they had a just cause to terminate complainants' employment.
The dispositive portion of the NLRC Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The decision of the labor arbiter is hereby reversed and set-aside. The complaint is dismissed for lack of merit. DETACa
SO ORDERED. 11
Aggrieved, Reyes and Bognot filed a Petition for Certiorari 12 before the CA. They imputed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the NLRC in relaxing procedural rules and allowing respondents to submit their evidence for the first time, even if the case was already on appeal.
Meanwhile, Eusebio no longer pursued his case.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
In its Decision 13 dated July 22, 2016, the CA affirmed the NLRC Decision and found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the latter in relaxing its procedural rules. The CA held that the respondents' failure to file their Position Paper and submit their evidence was justified and satisfactorily explained, ""since they were not given summons, nor notified of the scheduled preliminary conference and further hearings after the amended complaint was filed."" 14 After having settled the procedural issue, the CA proceeded to rule that ""petitioners were validly dismissed for a just and valid cause x x x."" 15
The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the Petition for Certiorari is DENIED. The assailed Decision and Resolution of public respondent NLRC are AFFIRMED in toto.
SO ORDERED. 16
Reyes and Bognot filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but it was denied in a Resolution 17 dated March 8, 2017.
Unyielding, Reyes elevated the case before this Court via a Petition for Review on Certiorari. On the other hand, Bognot yielded and no longer joined Reyes' petition.
Issues
1. Whether the CA erred in affirming the NLRC Decision which reversed the ruling of the Labor Arbiter; and
2. Whether Reyes was illegally dismissed.
Our Ruling
The appeal is meritorious.
The CA erred in affirming the
NLRC Decision.
a. Respondents were not denied
due process. A liberal
interpretation of the procedural
rules was not warranted.
On this point, Reyes mainly argues that —
The Court of Appeals abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in affirming the Decision of the NLRC which in effect declared that the NLRC did not abuse its discretion in applying the principle of liberal application of the procedural rules notwithstanding that it was not made an issue in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter, and ruling that respondent's Appeal is meritorious even though the appeal does not fall to (sic) any of the grounds for filing of appeal before the Commission. 18
Meanwhile, respondents assert that the NLRC and CA were correct in allowing them to present evidence, albeit belatedly; otherwise, their right to due process would have been denied. Further, they claim that ""there was no summons sent to any of the private respondents after the filing of the amended complaint."" 19
Respondents are wrong.
Due process has been described as a ""malleable concept anchored on fairness and equity."" 20 Indeed, at its core is simply the reasonable opportunity for every party to be heard. The late constitutionalist Father Joaquin G. Bernas, S.J., further expounds on this concept: aDSIHc
Whether in judicial or administrative proceedings, therefore, the heart of procedural due process is the need for notice and an opportunity to be heard. Moreover, what is required is not actual hearing but a real opportunity to be heard. Thus, one who refuses to appear at a hearing is not thereby denied due process if a decision is reached without waiting for him. Likewise, the requirement of due process can be satisfied by subsequent due hearing. 21 (Emphasis supplied).
Applying this principle, a review of the records will reveal that during the proceedings before the arbiter, respondents have been accorded ample opportunity to present their side. The arbiter made the following observations:
On June 4, 2013, after complainants filed their amended complaint, they filed their Position Paper. The respondents failed to appear but their counsel and representative appeared much earlier than the scheduled date of hearing and secured a photocopy of amended complaint. Thus, this Office directed the parties to appear [in] another conference on June 19, 2013 at 10:30 am to give respondents the opportunity to submit their position paper. Complainants manifested that if respondents would still fail to file their position paper on the next setting, this case should be deemed submitted their (sic) decision ex-parte.
On June 19, 2013, only complainants appeared and moved to submit this case for decision in view of the failure of the respondents to appear and submit their position paper despite ample time to (sic) given to them. 22
Based on this undisputed finding, it appears that respondents have unjustifiably missed at least two settings: that on June 4, 2013, and that on June 19, 2013. To stress, respondents missed the hearing on June 19, 2013 despite having been directed prior by the arbiter to attend. Moreover, it must be noted that respondents, at this point in time, have already obtained a copy of the amended complaint which would have enabled them to intelligently respond.
Respondents further explained in their Memorandum 23 filed before the CA:
16. x x x Here, there was no summons sent to any of the private respondents after the filing of the amended complaint. There was also no mandatory conciliation and mediation conference in two settings. As the Decision of the Honorable Labor Arbiter states, ""On June 4, 2013, after the complainants filed their amended complaint, they filed their Position Paper."" There was no mention of any issuance of summons to the private respondents and setting of mandatory conciliation and mediation conference. Further, no copy of the Position Paper was ever sent or received by the respondents. 24
Ruling for the Respondents, the CA held:
In this case, it is conceded that private respondents lost the case before the Labor Arbiter as they were not able to submit a position paper and adduce evidence in their behalf, nor to attend the scheduled preliminary conference. As found by public respondent NLRC, their failure to do so was satisfactorily explained, since they were not given summons, nor notified of the scheduled preliminary conference and further hearings after the amended complaint was filed. For this reason, public respondent NLRC ruled that such procedural oversights were not deliberate, dilatory or obstructive omissions on the part of private respondents. In short, their failure to present evidence and to attend the hearings can be justified due to lack of notice. x x x 25
We do not agree.
While it may be true that the arbiter failed to issue summons, such circumstance cannot operate as a denial of respondents' right to due process because the fact remains that respondents have already obtained a copy of the amended complaint, and have been duly notified of the June 19, 2013 hearing. Section 3 of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure (2011 NLRC Rules) provide:
SECTION 3. Issuance of Summons. — Within two (2) days from receipt of a complaint or amended complaint, the Labor Arbiter shall issue the required summons, attaching thereto a copy of the complaint or amended complaint and its annexes, if any. The summons shall specify the date, time and place of the mandatory conciliation and mediation conference in two (2) settings.
Clear from the foregoing that the issuance of summons is done in order to apprise the respondent of the case filed and as a means to furnish them a copy of the complaint so they can intelligently respond. Given the circumstances in the present case, the issuance of the summons would have been a mere superfluity since again, respondents have already obtained a copy of the amended complaint and notified of the upcoming hearing date. ETHIDa
To add, respondents' absence during the June 4, 2013 hearing is likewise unexplained, as confirmed by the NLRC in its Decision, to wit:
It appears that the same day that the parties met in an attempt to settle, which failed, the complainants filed an amended complaint in Regional Arbitration Branch III. No summons was issued after the amendment of the complaint. Thereafter, the complainants filed their position paper which was received by RAB III on June 4, 2013, during a hearing at which respondents were not present. The labor arbiter sent a notice of hearing dated June 6, 2013, informing respondents to appear for a conference on June 19, 2013 at 10:30 a.m. However, the registry return card on record, issued by the bureau of posts shows, that the respondents did not receive this notice of hearing until June 20, 2013. x x x 26 (Citations omitted.) (Emphases supplied.)
Thus, a closer examination at the findings of facts of both the Labor Arbiter and NLRC will reveal that there is no incongruence; in fact, they are in accord with and complement each other on the following points: first, that respondents were able to earlier secure a copy of the amended complaint; second, that respondents were absent during the June 4, 2013 and June 19, 2013 hearings; and third, that respondents' absences are unexplained.
Furthermore, we take note of the fact that from the date the respondents obtained a copy of the amended complaint in early June 2013, up to the promulgation of the arbiter's Decision on February 24, 2014, there was no initiative made by them to demand their day in court, so to speak. The records are simply bereft of even the slightest hint of participation from the respondents during the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter. If respondents truly hold sacred their right to due process as they so fervently contend before the NLRC and the CA, they would have wasted no time nor missed no opportunity to assert such right as early as during the initial stages of the proceedings. They could have at least pleaded for the arbiter to reopen the proceedings and admit their Position Paper, if there ever was one. At the very least, respondents were well-aware that a complaint was filed against them and this should have prompted them to be more proactive in the proceedings. Unfortunately, they failed to come through even in these simplest of tasks. In the Court's view, this cavalier attitude exhibited by respondents reeks of negligence and disrespect to duly instituted authorities and rules of procedures, either of which this Court can never tolerate.
While the Court commends the NLRC and the CA in upholding substantial justice, such principle must always be balanced with respect and honest efforts to comply with procedural rules. It cannot always be about substantial justice, especially to the point of disrespect and utter disregard to procedural rules. In Tible & Tible Company, Inc. v. Royal Savings and Loan Association, 27 an eloquent explanation regarding this balance was made:
Much reliance is placed on the rule that ""Courts are not slaves or robots of technical rules, shorn of judicial discretion. In rendering justice, courts have always been, as they ought to be, conscientiously guided by the norm that on balance, technicalities take a backseat against substantive rights, and not the other way around."" This rule must always be used in the right context, lest injustice, rather than justice would be its end result.
It must never be forgotten that, generally, the application of the rules must be upheld, and the suspension or even mere relaxation of its application, is the exception. This court previously explained:
The Court is not impervious to the frustration that litigants and lawyers alike would at times encounter in procedural bureaucracy but imperative justice requires correct observance of indispensable technicalities precisely designed to ensure its proper dispensation. It has long been recognized that strict compliance with the Rules of Court is indispensable for the prevention of needless delays and for the orderly and expeditious dispatch of judicial business.
Procedural rules are not to be disdained as mere technicalities that may be ignored at will to suit the convenience of a party. Adjective law is important in ensuring the effective enforcement of substantive rights through the orderly and speedy administration of justice. These rules are not intended to hamper litigants or complicate litigation but, indeed to provide for a system under which a suitor may be heard in the correct form and manner and at the prescribed time in a peaceful confrontation before a judge whose authority they acknowledge. cSEDTC
It cannot be overemphasized that procedural rules have their own wholesome rationale in the orderly administration of justice. Justice has to be administered according to the Rules in order to obviate arbitrariness, caprice, or whimsicality. x x x 28
In Loon v. Power Master, Inc., 29 the Court laid down the following pronouncement:
In labor cases, strict adherence to the technical rules of procedure is not required. Time and again, we have allowed evidence to be submitted for the first time on appeal with the NLRC in the interest of substantial justice. Thus, we have consistently supported the rule that labor officials should use all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, in the interest of due process.
However, this liberal policy should still be subject to rules of reason and fairplay. The liberality of procedural rules is qualified by two requirements: (1) a party should adequately explain any delay in the submission of evidence; and (2) a party should sufficiently prove the allegations sought to be proven. The reason for these requirements is that the liberal application of the rules before quasi-judicial agencies cannot be used to perpetuate injustice and hamper the just resolution of the case. Neither is the rule on liberal construction a license to disregard the rules of procedure. 30
In the present case, we have already extensively discussed how respondents failed to adequately explain and justify their non-participation in the proceedings before the arbiter. Thus, the application of a more liberal policy is unwarranted, contrary to the rulings of the NLRC and the CA. Besides, the policy of relaxed procedural rules in labor proceedings is mainly for the benefit of the employee, and not the employer, as will be discussed below.
b. Relaxed and liberal
interpretation of labor
procedures — mainly for the
benefit of employee, and not the
employer.
Preliminarily, the Court wishes to address respondents' argument that there were several procedural lapses committed by the arbiter in conducting the proceedings. Respondents repeatedly assert:
Section 3 of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure states that ""Within two (2) days from the receipt of a complaint or amended complaint, the Labor Arbiter shall issue the required summons, attaching thereto a copy of the complaint or amended complaint and its annexes, if any. The summons shall specify the date, time and place of the mandatory conciliation and mediation conference in two (2) settings x x x."" Here, there was no summons sent to any of the private respondents after the filing of the amended complaint. There was also no mandatory conciliation and mediation conference in two settings. As the Decision of the Honorable Labor Arbiter states, ""On June 4, 2013, after complainants filed their amended complaint, they filed their Position Paper.'' There was no mention of any issuance of summons to the private respondents and setting of mandatory conciliation and mediation conference. Further, no copy of the Position Paper was ever sent or received by the private respondents. 31 (Underscoring in the original)
In citing the 2011 NLRC Rules, respondents intimate that such should have been strictly followed; that the arbiter must be faulted for not doing so. However, respondents quickly backtracked and asserted before the NLRC that the rules — the very same one they demand to be strictly enforced — must be relaxed, obviously when it suited their favor. In the Court's view, this flip-flopping stand by the respondents betrays fairness in their position.
In any case, respondents in the present case are not entitled to be accorded a liberal interpretation of the rules; the same being primarily granted for the employee's favor, and not the employer. SDAaTC
The principles embodied by all prevailing labor rules, legislations, and regulations are derived from the Constitution, which intensely protects the working individual and deeply promotes social justice. Article II, Section 18 of the 1987 Constitution provides:
SECTION 18. The State affirms labor as a primary social economic force. It shall protect the rights of workers and promote their welfare.
Meanwhile, Article XIII, Section 3 state:
SECTION 3. The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.
Lastly, Article 4 of PD 442 32 or the Labor Code, provides:
Article 4. Construction in favor of labor. — All doubts in the implementation and interpretation of the provisions of this Code, including its implementing rules and regulations, shall be resolved in favor of labor.
The measures embedded in our legal system which accord specific protection to labor stems from the reality that normally, the laborer stands on unequal footing as opposed to an employer. Indeed, the labor force is a special class that is constitutionally protected because of the inequality between capital and labor. 33 In fact, labor proceedings are so informally and, as much as possible, amicably conducted and without a real need for counsel, perhaps in recognition of the sad fact that a common employee does not or have extremely limited means to secure legal services nor the mettle to endure the extremely antagonizing and adversarial atmosphere of a formal legal battle. Thus, in the common scenario of an unaided worker, who does not possess the necessary knowledge to protect his rights, pitted against his employer in a labor proceeding, We cannot expect the former to be perfectly compliant at all times with every single twist and turn of legal technicality. The same, however, cannot be said for the latter, who more often than not, has the capacity to hire the services of a counsel. As an additional aid therefore, a liberal interpretation of the technical rules of procedure may be allowed if only to further bridge the gap between an employee and an employer.
Relevant to this is Section 2 of the 2011 NLRC Rules which stipulates:
SECTION 2. CONSTRUCTION. — These Rules shall be liberally construed to carry out the objectives of the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines and other relevant legislations, and to assist the parties in obtaining just, expeditious and inexpensive resolution and settlement of labor disputes. (Emphasis supplied.)
As can be gleaned above, the 2011 NLRC Rules shall be liberally construed in order to attain two purposes: to carry out the objectives of the Constitution and relevant labor laws, and to assist the parties in obtaining a just, expeditious and inexpensive resolution and settlement of labor disputes. Focusing on the first purpose, We recall that one of the objectives of the Constitution is to accord special protection to labor. With this, it would therefore be fitting to say that the rules shall be liberally interpreted in order to accord special protection to labor. Truly, those who have less in life, should have more in law.
In Vicente v. Employees' Compensation Commission, 34 the Court held:
The court takes this occasion to stress once more its abiding concern for the welfare of government workers, especially the humble rank and file, whose patience, industry, and dedication to duty have often gone unheralded, but who, in spite of very little recognition, plod on dutifully to perform their appointed tasks. It is for this reason that the sympathy of the law on social security is toward its beneficiaries, and the law, by its own terms, requires a construction of utmost liberality in their favor. It is likewise for this reason that the Court disposes of this case and ends a workingman's struggle for his just dues. 35 (Citation omitted)
Further, as explained by Prof. Azucena:
In carrying out and interpreting the Labor Code's provisions and its implementing regulations, the working man's welfare should be the primordial and paramount consideration. This kind of interpretation gives meaning and substance to the liberal and compassionate spirit of the law as provided for in Article 4 of the New Labor Code. The policy is to extend the decree's applicability to a greater number of employees to enable them to avail of the benefits under the law, in consonance with the State's avowed policy to give maximum aid and protection to labor. 36 acEHCD
This is not to say however that the rules may never be relaxed in favor of the employer, and that every labor dispute will be automatically decided in favor of labor, thus:
Protection to labor and resolution of doubts in favor of labor cannot be pursued to the point of deliberately committing a miscarriage of justice. The right to obtain justice is enjoyed by all members of society, rich or poor, worker or manager, alien or citizen. Justice belongs to everyone. It is not to be blinded or immobilized by the fact of one's being economically underprivileged. x x x 37
In certain cases, of course, a liberal approach to the rules may be had even if it favors the employer. Such allowance, however, must be measured against standards stricter than that imposed against the worker, and only in compelling and justified cases where the employer will definitely suffer injustice should such liberal interpretation be disallowed. Unfortunately for respondents, this is not the situation in the present case.
Reyes was illegally dismissed by
RBSR.
Going now to the substantial issue, contrary to the findings of both the NLRC and the CA, we find that Reyes was illegally dismissed.
In dismissing Reyes, the records bare that RBSR sent him the following: first, a document with the subject ""Show Cause Order and Preventive Suspension"" 38 dated March 22, 2013 part of which reads:
Last 12 February 2013, during the Regular Board Meeting, the Corporate Secretary sent to you SES Form 6G, Report on Crimes and Losses for the discrepancy of the purchase price of the stocks brought by some stockholders. You refused to receive said document up until the last day for reporting which is 22 February 2013 for the reason that the same was sent via electronic mail.
xxx xxx xxx
Your refusal to do your duty shows that you have failed to observe your principal function to oversee and coordinate the implementation of the Compliance System. Your delays in transaction and inaction despite repeated reminders to do your job have caused significant prejudice and damage to the Bank.
xxx xxx xxx
Please explain in writing within five (5) days from receipt of this Memorandum why you should not be held administratively accountable and liable for your failure or refusal to fulfill your duties as a Compliance Officer. Considering the gravity of the charge and in order to safeguard the integrity of the bank records and operations, you are hereby preventively suspended for a period of thirty (30) days without pay effective immediately. You are however allowed access to bank records to help explain your side. 39
Based on this document, it would appear that Reyes was being charged with either willful disobedience or insubordination, or gross and habitual neglect of duty, both of which are just causes for termination of employment under the Labor Code.
Second, a document with the subject ""Administrative Case"" 40 dated April 4, 2013 which notified Reyes of a hearing scheduled on April 10, 2013.
Third, a document with the subject ""Show Cause Order"" 41 dated April 19, 2013 which partly states:
Please explain within five (5) days from receipt of this order why you should not be held administratively accountable and liable for your participation in the theft/misappropriation of the funds invested by and due to Mrs. Fidela M. Manago with the Rural Bank of San Rafael and for covering up such anomaly/offense. 42
Interestingly, based on this show cause order, it would appear that the charges against Reyes changed from either disobedience or neglect, to commission of a crime or offense.
Lastly, Reyes was issued a ""Notice of Termination"" 43 dated April 26, 2013 which provides: SDHTEC
Please be informed that after due consideration of the documents, records, testimonies, and admissions regarding your administrative case, the gravity and number of offenses that you committed, the magnitude of the loss and damage to the Bank and its clients, and the nature and sensitivity of your position, management has decided that there is sufficient and just cause for your termination.
You were duly informed of the charges against you and given sufficient time within which to explain your side with access to records and documents of the Bank, yet you failed or refused to submit any explanation. Neither did you appear during the scheduled hearing. These omissions were also considered in deciding the administrative case/s against you. 44
Book Five, Rule XXIII, Section 2 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code provides:
SECTION 2. Standards of due process; requirements of notice. — In all cases of termination of employment, the following standards of due process shall be substantially observed:
I. For termination of employment based on just causes as defined in Article 282 of the Code:
(a) A written notice served on the employee specifying the ground or grounds for termination, and giving to said employee reasonable opportunity within which to explain his side;
(b) A hearing or conference during which the employee concerned, with the assistance of counsel if the employee so desires, is given opportunity to respond to the charge, present his evidence or rebut the evidence presented against him; and
(c) A written notice of termination served on the employee indicating that upon due consideration of all the circumstances, grounds have been substantially established to justify his termination.
xxx xxx xxx
In King of Kings Transport, Inc. v. Mamac, 45 this concept of procedural due process in labor proceedings is further expounded: HSAcaE
To clarify, the following should be considered in terminating the services of employees:
(1) The first written notice to be served on the employees should contain the specific causes or grounds for termination against them, and a directive that the employees are given the opportunity to submit their written explanation within a reasonable period. ''Reasonable opportunity'' under the Omnibus Rules means every kind of assistance that management must accord to the employees to enable them to prepare adequately for their defense. This should be construed as a period of at least five (5) calendar days from receipt of the notice to give the employees an opportunity to study the accusation against them, consult a union official or lawyer, gather data and evidence, and decide on the defenses they will raise against the complaint. Moreover, in order to enable the employees to intelligently prepare their explanation and defenses, the notice should contain a detailed narration of facts and circumstances that will serve as basis for the charge against the employees. A general description of the charge will not suffice. Lastly, the notice should specifically mention which company rules, if any, are violated and/or which among the grounds under Art. 282 is being charged against the employees.
(2) After serving the first notice, the employers should schedule and conduct a hearing or conference wherein the employees will be given the opportunity to: (1) explain and clarify their defenses to the charge against them; (2) present evidence in support of their defenses; and (3) rebut the evidence presented against them by the management. During the hearing or conference, the employees are given the chance to defend themselves personally, with the assistance of a representative or counsel of their choice. Moreover, this conference or hearing could be used by the parties as an opportunity to come to an amicable settlement.
(3) After determining that termination of employment is justified, the employers shall serve the employees a written notice of termination indicating that: (1) all circumstances involving the charge against the employees have been considered; and (2) grounds have been established to justify the severance of their employment. 46 (Citations omitted.)
In the present case, while it is true that Reyes was given sufficient opportunity to explain his side during the investigation, the Court cannot help but notice the muddled and vague charges against him. Specifically, it cannot be determined with reasonable certainty on what grounds the charges pressed against Reyes were based on, and which ones were proven. While it would appear that Reyes was initially charged with insubordination or neglect of duty, the show cause order surprisingly accused him of participation in the alleged theft/misappropriation, and neither is there any showing that the same has been established nor is it specifically mentioned as the reason for his dismissal. Instead, the termination letter sent to Reyes, which is a mirror copy of the ones sent to Bognot and Eusebio, merely employed general and loose statements. Neither is there any mention of which specific rule or policy Reyes allegedly violated. Surely, this is not the kind of notice contemplated by the Labor Code and its implementing rules. In view of all the foregoing, the Court finds that respondents failed to comply with the due process requirements in dismissing Reyes.
Moving forward, We likewise find that there was no valid cause to dismiss Reyes.
The CA held:
With respect to petitioner Reyes — the Compliance Officer, it was his bounden duty to promptly certify the Report on Crimes and Losses detailing the irregularities; hence, for unjustifiably refusing to act on the report, as he should, he was validly terminated. x x x
x x x It is obvious that petitioner Reyes was foot-lagging on account of his complicity in the anomaly. As heretofore stated, an in-depth and independent investigation may still be made after the filing of the initial report. As We see it, there is no valid justification for petitioner Reyes' refusal to certify the report which, incidentally, is for the paramount interest of the bank. Thus, his act constitutes willful disobedience of a lawful order of his employer. x x x 47
In affirming the NLRC Decision which held Reyes' dismissal as valid, the CA considered Reyes' acts as willful disobedience, a just cause for the termination of an employee based on Article 297 (formerly Article 282) of the Labor Code.
We do not agree.
In Dongon v. Rapid Movers and Forwarders Co., Inc. 48 this Court held:
For willful disobedience to be a ground, it is required that: (a) the conduct of the employee must be willful or intentional and (b) the order the employee violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee, and must pertain to the duties that he had been engaged to discharge. Willfulness must be attended by a wrongful and perverse mental attitude rendering the employee's act inconsistent with proper subordination. In any case, the conduct of the employee that is a valid ground for dismissal under the Labor Code constitutes harmful behavior against the business interest or person of his employer. It is implied that in every act of willful disobedience, the erring employee obtains undue advantage detrimental to the business interest of the employer. 49
In the present case, there is no question that Reyes' refusal to certify the Report on Crimes and Losses was intentional. This is clearly disobedience. However, we find that the same is not attended by a wrongful and perverse mental attitude which warrants the ultimate penalty of dismissal.
A review of the findings below will reveal that Reyes refused to certify said report based on his honest assessment that the report cannot be completely validated for lack of material data and evidence. Indeed, as found by the CA:
As a consequence, in compliance with the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) mandating the prompt report of the anomaly to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Board of Directors of respondent RBSR approved a Report on Crimes and Losses describing the manner of the irregularities committed, and directed petitioner Reyes — as Compliance Officer — to certify the same as part of the requirement. However, Reyes refused to make the attestation on the reasoning that no independent investigation was conducted and that he cannot completely validate the report for lack of material data and evidence. 50 (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis supplied).
This assertion finds support in Memorandum No. 2013-020 51 dated February 14, 2013, and Memorandum No. 2013-022 52 dated February 22, 2013, both sent by Reyes to no less than the officers and directors of RBSR. In these Memoranda, Reyes noted several deficiencies in the report and even made recommendations in order to make the same compliant with BSP regulations. In the Court's view, this betrays respondents' claim that Reyes was involved in the theft/misappropriation allegedly committed by Bognot and Eusebio. AcICHD
Respondents counter Reyes' defense by saying:
Petitioner Reyes alleged that there was no personal investigation and judgment independent from the Audit Committee or from the Management, and that the data and evidence were lacking to satisfy a conclusion for the reporting of the discrepancy, so he refused to file the Crimes and Losses Report. However, in Circular No. 587, Series of 2007, x x x Subsection X162.4 (d.2) states that ""where a thorough investigation and evaluation is necessary to complete the report, an initial report submitted within the deadline may be accepted: Provided that a complete report is submitted not later than twenty (20) calendar days from termination of investigation."" Thus, his refusal is a gross negligence of his duties and obligations. Otherwise, he could have submitted an initial report and made his personal investigation and judgment independent from the Audit Committee or from the Management and submitted the same within the period mentioned. 53
The Court recognizes that there is reason for respondents' disappointment, even infuriation, over Reyes and his actions. Surely, no employer would find pleasure in a disobedient employee. Be that as it may, imposing the ultimate penalty of dismissal for such action — which, as already mentioned, obtains justification — and for such single instance, is simply too harsh and downright unlawful. Besides, what is the penalty for the late submission of the report? A miniscule monetary fine of P150.00 to P450.00 per day of delay. 54 Of course, this is not to encourage non-compliance with bank regulations, but is only mentioned to further highlight the point that the penalty of dismissal imposed upon Reyes was terribly disproportionate to his alleged infraction.
As a final note, it may be well to reiterate Justice Bellosillo's insightful observation in Alhambra Industries, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission: 55
TODAY employment is no longer just an ordinary human activity. For most families the main source of their livelihood, employment has now leveled off with property rights which no one may be deprived of without due process of law.
Termination of employment is not anymore a mere cessation or severance of contractual relationship but an economic phenomenon affecting members of the family. This explains why under the broad principles of social justice the dismissal of employees is adequately protected by the laws of the state. x x x 56
WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby GRANTED. The July 22, 2016 Decision of the Court of Appeals and March 8, 2017 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 139099, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The February 24, 2014 Decision of the Labor Arbiter in NLRC Case No. RAB-III-03-19924-13, is REINSTATED with a MODIFICATION in that petitioner Ariel M. Reyes' backwages shall be computed from the time of dismissal up to the finality of this Decision. All other matters not otherwise modified stand.

REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS, petitioner, vs. ESPINA & MADARANG, CO. and MAKAR AGRICULTURAL CORP., respondents.
DECISION
J.Y. LOPEZ, J p:
This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court filed by the Republic of the Philippines (Republic), represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision 2 dated January 25, 2016 and the Resolution 3 dated July 22, 2016 rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 06472-MIN, which affirmed in toto the Orders dated December 16, 2013, 4 February 24, 2014, 5 and July 21, 2014 6 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of General Santos City, Branch 36 in Civil Case No. 7788.
The Antecedents
Briefly, the present case involves the propriety of the Orders of the RTC of General Santos City, which (1) directed the Republic to deliver to the respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. (Espina and Makar) the amount of P218,839,455.00 representing their road right of way (RROW) compensation as payment for the property taken by the government for the construction of the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway; and (2) ordered the sheriff to levy, garnish, seize, and deliver to Makar or to the court, funds of the DPWH that may be found anywhere in the Philippines to satisfy the judgment in their favor. 7
The controversy originated from an undated letter of Vicente L. Olarte, the attorney-in-fact of the Olarte Hermanos y Cia Estate, to the Regional Director of the DPWH demanding for the payment of their RROW claim covering an area of 186,856 square meters taken by the government for the construction of the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway. 8

The foregoing was followed by a case entitled, ""In the matter of Insolvencia Voluntaria De Olarte Hermanos y Cia, Heirs of the Late Alberto P. Olarte and Jose P. Olarte, et al.,"" before the RTC of Cotabato City, Branch 14 docketed as Special Proceedings No. 2004-074 (Spec Pro. No. 2004-074). 9 In an Order dated July 4, 2007, the RTC of Cotabato City enjoined the DPWH to pay the RROW claim of the heirs of Olarte. In its subsequent Order dated November 13, 2007, the RTC of Cotabato City directed the DPWH to pay the heirs of Olarte the partial payment of their RROW compensation in the amount of P44,891,140.65 within ten days from notice. In compliance therewith, the DPWH started paying the same to the heirs of Olarte. 10
Civil Case No. 7788 (Injunction Case)
On May 7, 2008, Espina and Makar filed a complaint for injunction before the RTC of General Santos City docketed as Civil Case No. 7788 against the heirs of Alberto Pelayo Olarte and Jose Pelayo Olarte, the DPWH, and Register of Deeds of General Santos City. The complaint alleged that the Original Certificate of Title No. 12 (OCT No. 12) in the name of Olarte Hermanos, used as basis for the claim of the heirs of Alberto and Jose Olarte over the RROW compensation, was mortgaged to El Hogar Filipino (El Hogar). Due to nonpayment of the loan obligation, the property was sold at a public auction to El Hogar on October 15, 1933. Consequently, OCT No. 12 was canceled and TCT No. 886 was issued in the name of El Hogar. In 1937, El Hogar sold the property to the Espina sisters, namely: Salud, Soledad, Mercedes, and Asuncion to whom TCT No. (T-635) (T-19) T-2 was issued. Asuncion later on sold her share to Soledad in 1949, and TCT No. (T-636) (T-20) T-3 was issued in the name of the remaining three sisters. In 1958, the latter sold the property to Makar and TCT No. (T-5288) (T-433) T-118 was issued in its favor. Thereafter, Makar sold 195.1838 hectares of the property to Espina, which subdivided the same into lots and sold them to third parties. Despite the aforesaid change in ownership, Espina and Makar averred that the heirs of Olarte were able to file a RROW claim with the DPWH based on OCT No. 12. Hence, the complaint for injunction to enjoin the DPWH from paying the heirs of Olarte. 11
In response thereto, DPWH filed a Manifestation and Motion (in lieu of Answer) dated October 17, 2008, alleging that it already paid the heirs of Olarte upon their representation that they were the rightful owners of the property traversed by the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway. Considering the dispute on ownership, DPWH claimed that it would support any proceeding that would thresh out the issue and that it would cease from paying the heirs of Olarte until the issue of ownership is resolved. 12
On September 4, 2009, Espina and Makar filed a Manifestation to render Civil Case No. 7788 moot and academic in view of the Decision dated July 22, 2009 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02303-MIN, entitled ""Espina & Madarang, Co. & Makar Agricultural Corp. (Makar) represented by Rodrigo A. Adtoon, Petitioners v. Hon. Cedar P. Indar Al Haj, Judge, et al., Respondents."" Espina and Makar alleged that the aforesaid CA Decision already affirmed their ownership over the subject property and thus, the DPWH should be directed to release, in their favor, the payment of the RROW compensation. 13
In their Comment to the Manifestation, DPWH acknowledged that the injunction case was indeed rendered moot and academic in view of the Decision dated July 22, 2009 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02302-MIN. However, DPWH asserted that it was improper for the RTC to order the payment of the RROW compensation in favor of Espina and Makar without a definite ruling that the latter are the owners of the subject property. According to DPWH, the CA merely ruled that the special proceedings case cannot proceed as the heirs of Olarte were no longer the owners of the subject property. 14
Subsequently, on October 5, 2009, the RTC of General Santos City issued an Order ruling that the injunction case is already moot and academic in view of the Decision dated July 22, 2009 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 02302-MIN. It also upheld Espina and Makar's ownership over the subject property and ordered the DPWH to deliver to them the payment of their RROW compensation. 15
At odds with the ruling, DPWH moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the RTC of General Santos City in its Order dated October 30, 2009. 16 On even date, a notice of garnishment was likewise issued. 17 This was followed by a supplemental order dated November 13, 2009, directing the DPWH to pay Espina and Makar the amount of P218,839,455.00 representing the fair market value of the subject property as reflected in the masterlist of revalidated road right of way claim of the heirs of Olarte as of June 30, 2007. 18
CA-G.R. No. SP No. 03310-MIN
The Republic, through the DPWH, thereafter, filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with prayer for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction before the CA, seeking to nullify the RTC Orders dated October 5, 2009, October 30, 2009, and November 13, 2009. The case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN. The Republic contended that the RTC of General Santos City went beyond its jurisdiction when it ordered the payment of the RROW even if the same was not prayed for in the complaint; that such payment is improper in injunction cases, being limited only to restraining an act; that the ownership of Espina and Makar over the subject property was not definitely established; and that public funds cannot be the subject of garnishment. 19
Meanwhile, during the pendency of the case in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, the RTC of General Santos City issued an Order dated June 1, 2010, directing the issuance of a new writ of execution to implement the Orders dated October 5, 2009 and November 13, 2009. Subsequently, a writ of execution was issued on June 2, 2010. 20
On June 14, 2011, the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN rendered a Decision, denying the petition filed by Republic. The CA held therein that there was no more issue regarding the transfer of ownership from El Hogar to Espina and Makar. Therefore, the latter's title is presumed valid in view of the Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 025132, which this Court in G.R. No. 73457 has affirmed. It also ruled that the grant of the RROW compensation in the injunction suit is proper because the concept of injunction is not limited to restraining a party or refraining him from doing the questioned act, but also for doing an act. Finally, the CA ruled that the exemption of public funds from garnishment does not apply in this case because the funds sought to be levied were already allocated by law for the satisfaction of a money judgment against the government. In fact, the Republic had already been paying the heirs of Olarte in the special proceedings case. 21
Subsequently, the Republic moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated June 29, 2012. 22
G.R. No. 202416
Unsatisfied, the Republic elevated the matter to this Court by a petition for review on certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 202416. 23
On November 28, 2012, a Minute Resolution was issued by this Court, denying the petition for Republic's failure to sufficiently show reversible error in the challenged Decision of the CA to warrant the exercise of this Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction. In another Minute Resolution dated March 18, 2013, this Court denied Republic's motion for reconsideration with finality. 24
In view of the finality of G.R. No. 202416, Espina and Makar filed before the RTC of General Santos City an Ex-Parte Motion to Direct the Sheriff for Prompt and Immediate Implementation, praying for the reimplementation of the writ of execution dated June 2, 2010. 25
In its Order dated December 16, 2013, the RTC of General Santos City directed the sheriff to immediately implement the writ of execution. 26 The same was opposed by the heirs of Olarte. On the other hand, Espina and Makar filed an ex-parte motion to direct the sheriff for prompt and immediate implementation of the writ. 27
On February 24, 2014, the RTC of General Santos City denied the Motion of the heirs of Olarte and granted the motion of Espina and Makar, directing the sheriff to implement the writ of execution dated June 2, 2010, and to levy, garnish, seize, and deliver to them or the court, whatever funds, money, or assets of the DPWH susceptible to execution found anywhere in the Philippines to satisfy the judgment. 28
Thus, the Republic filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration, reiterating that public funds cannot be the subject of writ of execution. It added that Espina and Makar's claim should first be filed before the Commission on Audit (COA). The heirs of Olarte also filed a separate Motion for Reconsideration. 29
On July 21, 2014, the RTC of General Santos City issued an Order, denying both motions for reconsideration. 30
CA-G.R. SP No. 06472-MIN (the present case)
Undeterred by the setback, the Republic, as represented by the DPWH, once again filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the CA docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 06472-MIN. In support thereof, the Republic asserted that (1) the ownership of the subject property has not been settled; (2) the suability of the State does not mean liability because public funds cannot be the subject of garnishment; and (3) respondents should have first filed their claim before the COA. 31
On January 25, 2016, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, 32 affirming in toto the Orders dated December 16, 2013, February 24, 2014, and July 21, 2014 of the RTC of General Santos City. The CA ratiocinated that the issues raised by the Republic involving the ownership of the subject property and the suability of the State have already been settled in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, which this Court affirmed with finality in G.R. No. 202416. Thus, res judicata had already set in. 33
As for the Republic's claim that the money claim should have been first filed with the COA, the CA opined that Republic is already barred from invoking the same for failure to raise the said issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN. 34
Unconvinced, the Republic moved for reconsideration, but it proved futile as the CA denied the same in its impugned Resolution 35 dated July 22, 2016.
Hence, this present Petition.
Issues
The primordial issues for this Court's consideration are as follows:
I
Whether the CA erred in dismissing the petition on the ground of res judicata.
II
Whether the CA erred in ruling that petitioner is already barred from claiming that a money claim should be first filed before COA to execute the money judgment.
In the main, the petitioner submits that the case involves the disbursement of public funds in relation to the constitutional guarantee of payment of just compensation for properties taken for public use. Considering the transcendental importance and paramount public interest involved, petitioner insists that it was erroneous on the part of the CA to dismiss its petition based on mere technicalities rather than deciding the case on the merits. 36
Correlatively, petitioner recapitulates that there was no proper determination that the respondents are the rightful owners of the subject property. Respondents did not present any other evidence to prove their ownership apart from their reliance on case decisions, which did not conclusively declare them as the real owners. Without competent proof of ownership, petitioner stands firm in its contention that respondents are not entitled to the payment of the RROW compensation. 37
Petitioner likewise propounds that there was no proper determination that the amount of P218,839,455.00 is the full and fair market value of the property taken. 38 Petitioner highlights that the Order dated December 16, 2013 of the RTC of General Santos City, directing the DPWH to pay the respondents the aforesaid amount failed to explain the basis thereof. Similarly, the Order dated November 13, 2009 from where the said amount can be traced, failed to explain how the RTC arrived at such valuation. 39
In addition, petitioner maintains that the subsequent grant of the RROW compensation in the injunction proceedings is improper because there was no specific prayer for the payment of RROW compensation in the complaint. The payment of the RROW compensation cannot also be summarily done in an injunction suit. There must be an entirely different proceeding where the issue of ownership and payment of just compensation can be properly threshed out. 40
Assuming that the issue of ownership and just compensation has already been established, petitioner broaches the view that the execution of the money judgment against the government cannot proceed without compliance with these two requisites: (1) it must be covered by an appropriation; and (2) it must be approved by the COA. 41 Here, petitioner stresses that there is no longer an appropriation in this case because the DPWH already made partial payments to the heirs of Olarte, in the honest belief that they were the rightful owners of the subject property. Any unpaid amount, if any, was already reverted to the general fund and/or realigned to the other projects of the DPWH. 42 There was also no prior approval from the COA, 43 which is constitutionally mandated to examine, audit, and settle all monetary claims against the government. 44
Finally, petitioner asserts that the proper remedy of the respondents is to recover the payments already made to the heirs of Olarte instead of going after the government, through the DPWH, to disburse public funds anew for the same property. 45
For their part, respondents postulate that petitioner is already barred from questioning their ownership of the subject property, as well as the execution of the money judgment on DPWH funds, because these matters were already settled in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, which this Court affirmed with finality in G.R. No. 202416. 46 Petitioner's act of repeatedly raising the same issues settled with finality also constitutes forum shopping and a ground for contempt. 47
Respondents also submit that the petition is dismissible outright because the issues raised by the petitioner concerning the ownership of the subject property and the amount of RROW compensation are all factual in nature and thus, beyond the ambit of a Rule 45 petition, which is limited to questions of law. 48
As to the issue concerning the absence of prior COA approval, respondents insist that the petitioner belatedly raised the issue only during the execution stage. As such, it is already barred from contending that a money claim should be first filed before the COA for its approval. 49 At any rate, respondents posit that there is no need to file a money claim before the COA since the DPWH had already been paying the heirs of Olarte the proceeds of the RROW compensation without the approval of COA. The payment was made possible due to the appropriations released for the project on the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway. 50 Furthermore, the preaudit activities on government transactions were already lifted in COA Circular No. 2011-002. Similarly, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10752 or the Right of Way Act has simplified the acquisition of road right of way through an approved appropriation of necessary funds. Upon the approval of such funds, the rightful owners and recipients thereof are entitled to its payment without a need to present a claim before the COA. 51
In addition, respondents maintain that there is nothing irregular in the grant of the RROW compensation in the injunction suit because the concept of injunction is not only limited to refraining a party from doing an act, but also for doing an act. Likewise, even without specifically praying for the payment RROW compensation, its subsequent grant is proper under their general prayer for the grant of ""such other reliefs as are just and equitable under the premises"" in the complaint. 52
Respondents also recapitulate that garnishment of the DPWH funds is proper because an appropriation had already been passed for the funding of the national highway project through R.A. No. 9401 or the General Appropriations Act. 53
Lastly, respondents contend that they cannot be compelled to demand the payment of the RROW compensation from the heirs of Olarte, who merely received a partial payment of P44,891,140.65. Besides, there is no privity between them. The obligation to pay just compensation is demandable from the expropriator. Thus, they are entitled to receive the proceeds of the RROW compensation from the Republic and not from the heirs of Olarte. 54
Our Ruling
Prefatorily, the jurisdiction of this Court in a petition for review on certiorari is generally limited to errors of law. 55 Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court categorically states that the petition filed shall only raise questions of law, which must be distinctly set forth.
""A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts."" 56
For a question to be one of law, the question must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question posed is one of fact. 57
Here, a cursory reading of the petition shows that it is mainly anchored on issues involving a question of fact.
First, petitioner's contention that respondents have failed to present a conclusive proof of ownership and that there was no definite ruling that they are the rightful owners of the subject property would necessarily require the presentation of further evidence. This would entail this Court to analyze and reassess the evidence presented below to determine the issue of ownership. This is clearly outside the province of a petition for review on certiorari. ""It has been repeatedly pronounced that this Court is not a trier of facts. Evaluation of evidence is the function of the trial court."" 58
Second, petitioner's insistence that there was no basis for the computation of the just compensation in the amount of P218,839,455.00 is factual in nature. Its resolution would entail this Court to revisit or reevaluate the facts and documentary evidence, which the courts a quo used as basis to arrive at such valuation. Evidently, this is beyond the purview of a petition for review on certiorari. ""It is not the function of this Court to analyze or weigh all over again evidence already considered in the proceedings below."" 59 Under a Rule 45 petition, this Court's discretionary power of judicial review is confined to the review of errors of law committed by the appellate court.
More than being questions of fact, the issues raised by petitioner have actually been already adjudicated upon. It bears stressing that the present petition is an offshoot of the CA Decision 60 dated June 14, 2011, in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, where the CA affirmed the Orders of the RTC of General Santos City directing the DPWH to pay respondents the proceeds of the RROW compensation and the execution thereof on the funds of the DPWH. From this Decision, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, 61 but the CA denied the same in its Resolution 62 dated June 29, 2012. Petitioner then elevated the matter to this Court via a petition for review on certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 202416. In a Minute Resolution 63 dated November 28, 2012, this Court denied the petition in this wise:
Considering the allegations, issues and arguments adduced in the petition for review on certiorari with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order of the Decision and Resolution dated 14 June 2011 and 29 June 2012, respectively, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, the Court further resolves to DENY the petition for failure of petitioner to sufficiently show that the Court of Appeals committed any reversible error in the challenged decision and resolution as to warrant the exercise of the court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction. Moreover, the issues raised herein are factual in nature. 64 (Emphasis supplied)
Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but to no avail as this Court denied the same with finality in a Minute Resolution 65 dated March 18, 2013. Ultimately, G.R. No. 202416 became final and executory upon the entry of judgment on June 4, 2013. 66
Relevantly, one of the issues squarely addressed in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, which has attained finality in G.R. No. 202416, is the issue on respondents' ownership over the subject property. The CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN reads:
It must be emphasized that what was declared by this Court and the Supreme Court in CA-G.R. SP No. 02613 and G.R. No. 73457, respectively, as null and void was the December 7, 1983 Order of Judge Singayao which directed the cancellation of TCT No. 886 to reinstate the title of the Olartes under OCT No. 12. Hence, TCT No. 886 remained valid to this date. It was adjudicated with finality that El Hogar's title to the subject property was regular, legal and valid. On the other hand, there was never any issue or irregularity that was assailed from El Hogar's title up to the title of private respondents. In other words, no decree or order from the court was it declared that the transfer of ownership from El Hogar to the Espina Sisters to Makar and then to Espina & Madarang Company was invalid, irregular or unlawful. Hence, petitioner now cannot make any presumptions that private respondent's title to the said property is bogus. Moreover, petitioner has no jurisdiction to determine by itself despite the court order as to who the owner of the subject property is. As advert, the issue of ownership has already been settled. It cannot now impose upon itself the power to determine the ownership, otherwise, it would be encroaching into the jurisdiction of the regular courts.
Anent its allegation that public respondent seemed to be taking the cudgels for private respondents, the same deserves scant consideration. This is not the only time that the court a quo made a pronouncement that the owners of the property are private respondents. The Supreme Court itself and this Court in several cases (particularly CA-G.R. SP No. 02613 and G.R. No. 73457; G.R. No. 80784 and 82201; and CA-G.R. SP No. 0203-Min) affirmed the validity of TCT No. 886, to which private respondents derived their title. 67 (Emphases supplied)
From the foregoing, it can be gleaned that there was a categorical declaration that the respondents are the owners of the subject property. The same was based on the finding that: (1) TCT No. 866, the source of their title, and their present title are valid; and (2) there was no decree or judgment declaring invalid, irregular, or unlawful the transfer of ownership of the subject property from El Hogar until to the respondents.
Another issue passed upon by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, which petitioner continues to assail in this present petition, is the propriety of the Order of the RTC of General Santos City, directing the DPWH to pay respondents the RROW compensation in the injunction proceedings. Like the case before Us, petitioner contended therein that the grant of the RROW compensation in favor of the respondents is improper because (1) the same was not specifically prayed for in the complaint; and (2) a different action should be instituted for the payment of the RROW compensation. In rejecting petitioner's contentions, the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN held as follows:
Likewise, while petitioner asserts that private respondent[s] did not pray in their Complaint the payment of the RROW compensation in their favor, the same is however covered under the general prayer of ""plaintiffs further prayer for such other reliefs as are just and equitable under the premises.""
Petitioner's assertion that the order directing the payment of the RROW compensation in favor of private respondents is not proper in injunction proceedings which aim only to restrain a party from performing the questioned acts is also not tenable. An injunction is a judicial writ, process or proceeding whereby a party is ordered to do or refrain from doing a particular act. Hence, an injunction is not limited to restrain a party or refrain him from doing the questioned act, but also for doing an act. 68
To stress anew, the aforesaid findings of the CA had already attained finality, as being effectively affirmed in G.R. No. 202416.
As to petitioner's contention that there is no basis for the computation of the just compensation in the amount of P218,839,455.00, the same can be traced from the Supplemental Order 69 dated November 13, 2009 of the RTC of General Santos City, which reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Supplemental Order is issued to clarify the amount to be paid by DPWH to the plaintiffs.
Accordingly, the Regional Director, DPWH Regional Office XII in Koronadal City is hereby directed, under pain of judicial sanctions, to deliver and pay plaintiffs the amount of P218,839,455.00 representing the market value of the aforementioned properties reflected in the master list of revalidated road right of way claim of Olarte Hermanos y Cia represented by Mercedita Dumalo as of June 30, 2007, and further, whose claim thereto has no legal basis since the said claimants are no longer the owner of said properties but plaintiffs and their predecessors-in-interest as ruled by the Honorable Supreme Court and reiterated and re-affirmed by the Honorable Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City, including all other appropriations and allotments for Lot A, G & F, Swo-12-000103, National Highway, General Santos City, re-valued using the 2009 BIR Zonal Valuation. 70 (Emphasis supplied)
The aforesaid Supplemental Order was among the Orders of the RTC of General Santos City, which the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN has affirmed in toto, to wit:
WHEREFORE, premises foregoing, the instant petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit and the assailed Orders dated October 5, 2009, October 30, 2009 and November 13, 2009 and the Notice of Garnishment dated October 30, 2009 in Civil Case No. 7788 are AFFIRMED in toto. 71 (Emphasis supplied)
To reiterate, the aforesaid findings of the CA, which affirmed the basis and the amount of RROW compensation to which respondents are entitled, have become final and executory in G.R. No. 202416.
From the foregoing, it is decisively clear that majority of the issues raised by petitioner in this case have already been thoroughly discussed and judiciously resolved with finality in G.R. No. 202416. Thus, it now becomes unnecessary for this Court to delve on these matters again lest We transgress the doctrine of finality of judgment.
""Under the doctrine of finality of judgment, a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law, and whether it be made by the court that rendered it or by the Highest Court of the land. Any act [that] violates this principle must immediately be struck down."" 72
True, the doctrine on immutability of final judgments admits of few certain exceptions, such as: ""(1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries [that] cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable."" 73 Regrettably, none of these exceptional circumstances exist here.
Closely intertwined with the doctrine of finality of judgment is the principle of res judicata.
As defined in jurisprudence, res judicata is ""a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment."" 74 ""It also refers to the rule that a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on points and matters determined in the former suit."" 75
""It rests on the principle that parties should not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate."" 76
The doctrine rests upon the principle that ""'parties ought not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once[.]' It 'exists as an obvious rule of reason, justice, fairness, expediency, practical necessity, and public tranquility.'"" 77
In this jurisdiction, the concept of res judicata is encapsulated in Section 47 (b) and (c) of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, thus:
SECTION 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. — The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:
(a) In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration, or the condition, status or relationship of the person; however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;
(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and
(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (Emphases supplied)
The above provision delineates the dual aspect of res judicata. Section 47 (b) refers to res judicata in its concept as ""bar by prior judgment"" or ""estoppel by verdict,"" which ""is the effect of a judgment as a bar to the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim, demand, or cause of action."" 78 On the other hand, Section 47 (c) pertains to res judicata in its concept as ""conclusiveness of judgment"" or otherwise known as the rule of auter action pendant, which ""ordains that issues actually and directly resolved in a former suit cannot again be raised in any future case between the same parties involving a different cause of action."" 79
Succinctly, res judicata in its concept as ""bar by prior judgment"" requires the concurrence of the following requisites: ""(1) the former judgment is final; (2) it is rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) it is a judgment or an order on the merits; and (4) there is — between the first and the second actions — identity of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action."" 80
All these elements exist in this case.
As to the first requisite, there is a final judgment or order, that is, this Court's Resolution dated September 28, 2012 in G.R. No. 202416, which has long attained finality on June 4, 2013.
Anent the second and third requisites, the Resolution dated September 28, 2012 of this Court in G.R. No. 202416 was rendered in affirmation of the earlier Orders dated October 5, 2009, October 30, 2009 and November 13, 2009, and the Notice of Garnishment dated October 30, 2009 of the RTC of General Santos City, as well as the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN, all of which have decided the case on the merits, and with the courts that rendered them having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.
Finally, on the fourth requisite, the parties in G.R. No. 202416 are the same parties in this present petition. The subject matters and causes of action of the two cases are also identical.
Case law instructs that ""[a] subject matter is the item with respect to which the controversy has arisen, or concerning which the wrong has been done, and it is ordinarily the right, the thing, or the contract under dispute."" 81 In this case, both the first and second actions involve the same subject matter that is — the conclusiveness of respondent's ownership over the subject property, the entitlement of respondent to the RROW compensation, and the nonsuability of the State.
On the other hand, Section 2, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court defines a cause of action as ""the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another."" In Yap v. Chua, 82 this Court held that the ""test to determine whether the causes of action are identical is to ascertain whether the same evidence would support both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would support both actions, then they are considered the same; and a judgment in the first case would be a bar to the subsequent action."" 83
Here, the two cases involve the same cause of action, i.e., the propriety of orders directing the DPWH to pay the RROW compensation of the respondents. The two cases also stemmed from the same set of facts and involve the same pieces of evidence.
Given the foregoing, this Court adopts the findings of the CA that res judicata in its concept as ""bar by prior"" judgment had already set in. Consequently, the issues concerning the ownership of the respondents over the subject property and their entitlement to the RROW compensation should now be laid to rest and no longer relitigated upon. As this Court enunciated in Monterona v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.: 84
Res judicata requires that stability be accorded to judgments. Controversies once decided on the merits shall remain in repose for there should be an end to litigation which, without the doctrine, would be endless. x x x. 85
Be that as it may, this Court must reassess the pronouncement of the CA that petitioner is already barred from contending that a money claim should first be filed before the COA for failure to raise the issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 03310-MIN.
Firstly, the State cannot be estopped by the omission, mistake, or error of its officials or agents, 86 more so, in this case which involves the disbursement of public funds.
Further, it is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended, or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in the operations of government. 87 Thus, as the guardian of public funds and properties, COA has the constitutionally mandated power to ""examine, audit and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned, or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities,"" 88 cannot be waived.
Secondly, in Taisei Shimizu Joint Venture v. Commission on Audit (Taisei), 89 this Court specified the two main types of money claims that may be instituted before the COA:
(1) money claims originally filed with the COA; and
(2) money claims which arise from a final and executory judgment of a court or arbitral body.
In distinguishing these two types of money claims, this Court adopted the opinion of COA Chairperson Michael G. Aguinaldo in this wise:
There is merit to Chairperson Aguinaldo's opinion pertaining to the two (2) main types of money claims which the COA may be confronted with.
The first type covers money claims originally filed with the COA. Jurisprudence specifies the nature of the money claims which may be brought to the COA at first instance. In Euro-Med Laboratories, Phil., Inc. v. Province of Batangas, we explicitly ordained that these cases are limited to liquidated claims, viz.:
The scope of the COA's authority to take cognizance of claims is circumscribed, however, by an unbroken line of cases holding statutes of similar import to mean only liquidated claims, or those determined or readily determinable from vouchers, invoices, and such other papers within reach of accounting officers. Petitioner's claim was for a fixed amount and although respondent took issue with the accuracy of petitioner's summation of its accountabilities, the amount thereof was readily determinable from the receipts, invoices and other documents. Thus, the claim was well within the COA's jurisdiction under the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.
We agree with Chairperson Aguinaldo that the following discussion in Uy involved the first type of money claims, viz.:
SECOND. The case at bar brings to the fore the parameters of the power of the respondent COA to decide administrative cases involving expenditure of public funds. Undoubtedly, the exercise of this power involves the quasi-judicial aspect of government audit. As statutorily envisioned, this pertains to the ""examination, audit, and settlement of all debts and claims of any sort due from or owing to the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities."" The process of government audit is adjudicative in nature. The decisions of COA presuppose an adjudicatory process involving the determination and resolution of opposing claims. Its work as adjudicator of money claims for or against the government means the exercise of judicial discretion. It includes the investigation, weighing of evidence, and resolving whether items should or should not be included, or as applied to claim, whether it should be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part. Its conclusions are not mere opinions but are decisions which may be elevated to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party.
We, too agree with Chairperson Aguinaldo that the second type of money claims refers to those which arise from a final and executory judgment of a court or arbitral body. He also correctly cited Uy, reiterating our undeviating jurisprudence that final judgments may no longer be reviewed or, in any way be modified directly or indirectly by a higher court, not even by the Supreme Court, much less, by any other official, branch or department of government. 90
Under the second type of money claims, this Court in Taisei laid down the guiding principles in the exercise of the COA's audit powers that may be instituted before it during the execution stage:
x x x. [W]e lay down a conceptual framework for the guidance of the COA, the Bench, and the Bar pertaining to the COA's audit power vis-a-vis the second type of money claims which may be brought before it during the execution stage.
III. The COA's audit review power over money claims already confirmed by final judgment of a court or other adjudicative body is necessarily limited.
A. Once a court or other adjudicative body validly acquires jurisdiction over a money claim against the government, it exercises and retains jurisdiction over the subject matter to the exclusion of all others including the COA.
Even if we broadly interpret the COA's jurisdiction as including all kinds of money claims, it cannot take cognizance of factual and legal issues that have been raised or could have been raised in a court or other tribunal that had previously acquired jurisdiction over the same. To repeat, the COA's original jurisdiction is actually limited to liquidated claims and quantum meruit cases. It cannot interfere with the findings of a court or an adjudicative body that decided an unliquidated money claim involving issues requiring the exercise of judicial functions or specialized knowledge and expertise which the COA does not have in the first place.
B. The COA has no appellate review power over the decisions of any other court or tribunal.
Once judgment is rendered by a court or tribunal over a money claim involving the State, it may only be set aside or modified through the proper mode of appeal. It is elementary that the right to appeal is statutory. There is no constitutional nor statutory provision giving the COA review powers akin to an appellate body such as the power to modify or set aside a judgment of a court or other tribunal on errors of fact or law.
C. The COA is devoid of power to disregard the principle of immutability of final judgments.
xxx xxx xxx.
D. The COA's exercise of discretion in approving or disapproving money claims that have been determined by final judgment is akin to the power of an execution court. 91
Indubitably, even if the court-adjudicated money judgment had become final and executory, the claimant is still required to file a money claim before the COA to effect payment. The authority of the COA, in this regard, rests in ensuring that public funds are not diverted from their legally appropriated purpose to answer for such money judgment. 92 However, the jurisdiction of the COA is confined only to the execution stage. It has no power or authority to overturn a court's final and executory judgment against the State.
In this case, it is beyond cavil that respondents' claim for the payment of the RROW compensation falls under the second type of money claims or those money claims arising from a final and executory judgment of a court. Thus, to execute the same, respondents should have first filed a money claim before the COA, who shall act as an execution court. Noncompliance with this indispensable requirement will result in the invalidation of a courts' writ of execution or garnishment against government funds.
The case of Roxas v. Republic Real Estate Corp. 93 (Roxas) is instructive on this point. Therein, this Court upheld the CA when it nullified the writ of execution issued by the RTC over government funds for the payment of reclamation work done by Republic Real Estate Corporation. This Court then elaborated on the process and applicable laws in pursuing monetary claims against the government, viz.:
The case is premature. The money claim against the Republic should have been first brought before the Commission on Audit.
The Writ of Execution and Sheriff De Jesus' Notice [of Execution] violate this Court's Administrative Circular No. 10-2000 and Commission on Audit Circular No. 2001-002, which govern the issuance of writs of execution to satisfy money judgments against government.
Administrative Circular No. 10-2000 dated October 25, 2000 orders all judges of lower courts to observe utmost caution, prudence, and judiciousness in the issuance of writs of execution to satisfy money judgments against government agencies. This Court has emphasized that:
xxx xxx xxx.
[I]t is settled jurisprudence that upon determination of State liability, the prosecution, enforcement or satisfaction thereof must still be pursued in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down in Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines . . . All money claims against the Government must first be filed with the Commission on Audit which must act upon it within sixty days. Rejection of the claim will authorize the claimant to elevate the matter to the Supreme Court on certiorari and in effect sue the State thereby (Presidential Decree No. 1445, Sections 49-50).
For its part, Commission on Audit Circular No. 2001-002 dated July 31, 2001 requires the following to observe this Court's Administrative Circular No. 10-2000; department heads; bureau, agency, and office chiefs; managing heads of government-owned and/or controlled corporations; local chief executives; assistant commissioners, directors, officers-in-charge, and auditors of the Commission on Audit; and all others concerned.
Chapter 4, Section 11 of Executive Order No. 292 gives the Commission on Audit the power and mandate to settle all government accounts. Thus, the finding that government is liable in a suit to which it consented does not translate to enforcement of the judgment by execution.
As a rule, public funds may not be disbursed absent an appropriation of law or other specific statutory authority. Commonwealth Act No. 327, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1445, requires that all money claims against government must first be filed before the Commission on Audit, which, in turn, must act upon them within 60 days.
Only when the Commission on Audit rejects the claim can the claimant elevate the matter to this Court on certiorari and, in effect, sue the state. Carabao, Inc. v. Agricultural Productivity Commission has settled that ""claimants have to prosecute their money claims against the Government under Commonwealth Act 327 . . . and that the conditions provided in Commonwealth Act 327 for filing money claims against the Government must be strictly observed. 94 (Emphases supplied)
Irrefragably, for money judgments that have become final and executory, the filing of a prior claim before the COA serves as a sine qua non condition to effect payment. If this procedure is not strictly followed, writs of execution or garnishment against government funds intended to satisfy money judgments will be invalidated.
Lastly, ""government funds and properties may not be seized under writs of execution or garnishment to satisfy court judgments, and disbursement of public funds cannot be made unless covered by a corresponding appropriation."" 95
In Republic v. Hon. Hidalgo, 96 this Court illumined that ""a judgment against the State generally operates merely to liquidate and establish the plaintiff's claim in the absence of express provision; otherwise, they cannot be enforced by processes of law."" 97
In this case, there is no dispute that there was already an allocated RROW funds for the payment of the subject property taken by the DPWH for the construction of the Cotabato-Kiamba-General Santos-Koronadal National Highway. In fact, petitioner, through the DPWH, admitted that it already made partial payments to the heirs of Olarte, who misrepresented themselves as the owner of the subject property. The partial payments made to the heirs of Olartes were taken from the proceeds of the said RROW funds. 98
Petitioner, however, contends that the Masterlist of Revalidated Road Right of Way Claims for DPWH-Region XII, which provided the amount which should be paid as RROW compensation to the heirs of Olarte was dated ""as of 30 June 2007,"" or almost 15 years ago. Further, there is no more appropriation to speak of, as the DPWH already made partial payments to the heirs of Olarte. Any amount unpaid, if any, had already been reverted to the general fund and/or realigned to the other projects of the DPWH. 99
Considering the circumstances surrounding petitioner's claims, this Court is convinced that there is more reason to refer the execution of the RROW compensation to the COA, which, in relation to its audit review power, can determine the source of public funds from which the final and executory money judgment may be satisfied pursuant to the general auditing laws the COA is tasked to implement. 100
In any case, even if there is an existing appropriation and funding for the project, the same does not dispense with the need to file a prior money claim before the COA.
Pertinent on this matter is the case of Republic v. Fetalvero, 101 which involved the payment of just compensation for the taking of a private property used for the construction of DPWH's flood control project. One of the issues raised therein was whether government funds may be seized under a writ of execution or a writ of garnishment in satisfaction of court judgments. In resolving the issue, this Court emphasized that public funds cannot be the subject of garnishment or levy in the absence of an appropriation. However, even if there is an existing appropriation and compromise agreement in favor of the claimant, the latter is still required to follow the appropriate procedure laid down in the Roxas case, where the claimant is required to file their money claim before the COA. If this procedure is not complied with, the satisfaction of the claimant's money judgment cannot proceed through a courts' writ of execution or garnishment, viz.:
The general rule is that government funds cannot be seized by virtue of writs of execution or garnishment. This doctrine has been explained in Commissioner of Public Highways v. San Diego:
The universal rule that where the State gives its consent to be sued by private parties either by general or special law, it may limit claimant's action ""only up to the completion of proceedings anterior to the stage of execution"" and that the power of the Courts ends when the Judgment is rendered, since government funds and properties may not be seized under writs of execution or garnishment to satisfy such judgments, is based on obvious considerations of public policy. Disbursements of public funds must be covered by the corresponding appropriation as required by law. The functions and public services rendered by the State cannot be allowed to be paralyzed or disrupted by the diversion of public funds from their legitimate and specific objects, as appropriated by law.
Simply put, ""no money can be taken out of the treasury without an appropriation."" Here, the trial court already found that:
[T]here is an appropriation intended by law for payment of road-rights-of-way. Defendant [respondent here] even called the attention of the court of the existence of SAA-SR 2009-05-001538 of the DPWH Main and/or Regional Office appertaining to the fund intended for payment of the road-rights-of-way.
Even petitioner admitted in its Memorandum ""the approval of allocation for payment of road right of way projects within Region 10 under SAA-SR 2009-001538[.]"" Since there is an existing appropriation for the payment of just compensation, and this Court already settled that petitioner is bound by the Compromise Agreement, respondent is legally entitled to his money claim. However, he still has to go through the appropriate procedure for making a claim against the Government.
xxx xxx xxx.
Here, as in Atty. Roxas, respondent failed to show that he first raised his claim before the Commission on Audit. Without this necessary procedural step, respondent's money claim cannot be entertained by the courts through a writ of execution. 102 (Emphases supplied)
Considering the foregoing, this Court is convinced that the CA erred when it affirmed the Orders of the RTC of General Santos City, in so far as it directed the immediate implementation of the writ of execution and to levy, garnish, and seize the funds and assets of the DPWH to satisfy the RROW compensation of the respondents. Despite the rendition of a final and executory judgment validating their entitlement to the RROW compensation, the respondents are still required to pursue their claim before the COA for its execution. It is not within the court's power to determine how the money judgment should be enforced or satisfied as the primary jurisdiction to determine the same rests with the COA.
WHEREFORE, premises considered the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated January 25, 2016 and the Resolution dated July 22, 2016 of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 06472-MIN is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION to read as follows:
The Orders dated December 16, 2013, February 24, 2014, and July 21, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of General Santos City, Branch 36 in Civil Case No. 7788 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE in so far as they directed the Sheriff to reimplement the Writ of Execution dated June 2, 2010 and to levy, garnish, seize, and deliver to respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp., or to the court whatever funds, money, or assets of the Department of Public Works and Highways susceptible to execution found anywhere in the Philippines to satisfy the judgment in favor of the respondents.
Respondents Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp., are hereby enjoined to file a money claim before the Commission on Audit for the satisfaction and enforcement of the money judgment validating their claim to the Road Right of Way compensation.
SO ORDERED.

[G.R. No. 214195. March 23, 2022.]
UNIMASTERS CONGLOMERATION INCORPORATED, petitioner, vs. TACLOBAN CITY GOVERNMENT, PRIVATIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OFFICE, PHILIPPINE TOURISM AUTHORITY, AND THE PROVINCE OF LEYTE, respondent.
DECISION
J.Y. LOPEZ, J p:
Before Us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 dated September 26, 2014, under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking the reversal of the Decision 2 dated August 22, 2014 in CTA EB No. 901 rendered by the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc.
Facts
Leyte Park Hotel, Inc. (LPHI) is a 61,322-square meter property that stands on Magsaysay Boulevard, Tacloban City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1883. It is co-owned by Assets Privatization Trust (APT), now Privatization and Management Office (PMO), the Province of Leyte, and the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA), now Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA). APT/PMO holds 34% of the shares while PTA and the Province of Leyte hold 40% and 26% of the shares, respectively. 3
On September 15, 1994, then APT, representing the owners of LPHI, and Unimasters Conglomeration Incorporated (UCI), through its President, Wilson Chan (Chan), entered into a Contract of Lease over LPHI with a duration of 12 years. 4 A stipulation in the contract provides:
COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS
xxx xxx xxx
Section 11.04. Real property taxes shall be for the account of the LESSOR. Any payment of real property taxes by the LESSEE shall be credited against any amount due from the LESSEE to the LESSOR; 5
xxx xxx xxx
Initially, UCI was faithfully paying its monthly rentals and real property taxes, the latter payments were subsequently credited to its rental payment. 6 However, starting December 16, 2000, UCI stopped paying its obligations, prompting PMO to send several letters demanding compliance with the provisions of the contract. Even so, the agreement expired without UCI settling its obligations. Since then, UCI has retained possession and enjoyment of the premises without paying any rentals and taxes due. 7
Meanwhile, the City Treasurer of Tacloban sent several demand letters 8 to Chan to collect the unpaid real property taxes of LPHI for the years 1989 to 2012 in the amount of P65,969,406.74, but the same remained unpaid despite notice. Hence, the City Treasurer of Tacloban instituted a collection case against LPHI, UCI, APT, PTA, and the Province of Leyte before the CTA. The case was subsequently docketed as CTA OCA No. 012.
After trial, the CTA (Special First Division) rendered a Decision, 9 dated November 15, 2011, which found UCI liable to pay the amount of P22,826,902.20. However, the CTA recognized the clause in the Contract of Lease signed by the parties which allowed the crediting of any payments made by UCI against its rentals. 10
UCI moved for reconsideration. When its motion was denied, UCI filed a petition for review before the CTA En Banc. 11
After due proceedings, the CTA En Banc issued the assailed Decision, 12 dated August 22, 2014, which affirmed UCI's liability to pay the realty taxes for the period covering 1995-2004. Citing the cases of GSIS v. City Treasurer and City Assessor of the City of Manila 13 and Republic v. City of Kidapawan, 14 the CTA En Banc stood firm in ruling that realty tax pertaining to government assets attach to the property and is chargeable against the taxable person who had actual or beneficial use and possession of it regardless of whether or not he is the owner. 15
As regards the enforceability of the contractual obligation of the local government units, particularly the crediting of paid realty taxes on UCI's account, the CTA En Banc deferred to resolve the issue considering the pendency of a case involving the validity of the lease agreement between the parties. 16
Dissatisfied, UCI elevated the case to this Court ascribing error on the part of the CTA in holding UCI liable to pay the real property tax sought by the City Government of Tacloban over LPHI and in refusing to enforce the provision in the contract whereby PMO, PTA and the Province of Leyte contractually assumed liability to pay the taxes due. 17
UCI urges this Court to nullify the CTA rulings which applied the beneficial use principle. Citing the case of City of Pasig v. Republic of the Philippines, 18 UCI argues that the payment of realty taxes over LPHI should rest on the Republic in case the beneficial user failed to pay the required taxes thereon especially so in this case that the Republic, through the PMO, PTA, and the Province of Leyte, has waived its tax exemption when it contractually assumed the payment of real property taxes in the lease contract. 19
Our Ruling
We deny the petition for failure of the petitioner to show that the CTA En Banc committed any reversible error in dismissing its appeal.
The CTA En Banc is correct in denying petitioner's appeal and, in effect, affirming the ruling of the CTA Division which found it liable to pay real property taxes over the LPHI property.
As cited by the CTA En Banc, Section 234 (a) of the Local Government Code exempts the real properties owned by the Republic from payment of real property tax, to wit:
Section 234. Exemptions from Real Property Tax. — The following are exempted from payment of real property tax:
(a) Real property owned by the Republic of the Philippines or any of its political subdivisions except when the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration or otherwise to a taxable person;
(b) Charitable institutions, churches, parsonages, or convents appurtenant thereto, mosques, non-profit or religious cemeteries and all lands, buildings and improvements actually, directly and exclusively used for religious, charitable, and educational purposes;
(c) All machineries and equipment that are actually, directly and exclusively used by local water districts and government-owned or controlled corporations engaged in the supply and distribution of water and/or generation and transmission of electric power;
(d) All real property owned by duly registered cooperatives as provided for under RA 6938; and
(e) Machinery and equipment used for pollution control and environmental protection. 20 (Emphases supplied)
It is noticeable that the above-mentioned provision also contains a limitation to the exemption granted to the Republic or any of its political subdivisions when the beneficial use of the real property it owns is granted to a taxable person. At this point, it must be clarified that the term Republic likewise includes government instrumentalities as held in Philippine Heart Center v. The Local Government of Quezon City. 21 Clearly, government instrumentalities are exempt from real property tax but the exemption shall not extend to taxable private entities to whom the beneficial use of the government instrumentality's properties has been vested. 22
Certainly, the hotel, which is the subject matter of this case, is owned in common by the Province of Leyte, which is a political subdivision, and by PMO and PTA, both government instrumentalities that are exempt from payment of real property taxes. The subsequent execution of a Contract of Lease between the co-owners of LPHI and UCI, a private entity, did not divest the former of their exemption from realty taxes, only that the hotel lost the exemption from being taxed and the burden to pay the taxes due thereon, passed on to UCI as the beneficial user thereof.
In MWSS v. Central Board of Assessment Appeals, 23 We emphasized that while the liability for taxes generally falls on the owner of the real property, personal liability for real property taxes may also expressly rest on the entity with the beneficial use of the real property at the time the tax accrues.
Parenthetically, in City Treasurer of Taguig v. Bases Conversion and Development Authority, 24 citing National Power Corporation v. Province of Quezon, et al., 25 We made explicit that the obligation to pay real property taxes rests on the person who derives benefit from its utilization, thus:
The liability for taxes generally rests on the owner of the real property at the time the tax accrues. This is a necessary consequence that proceeds from the fact of ownership. However, personal liability for realty taxes may also expressly rest on the entity with the beneficial use of the real property, such as the tax on property owned by the government but leased to private persons or entities, or when the tax assessment is made on the basis of the actual use of the property. In either case, the unpaid realty tax attaches to the property but is directly chargeable against the taxable person who has actual and beneficial use and possession of the property regardless of whether or not that person is the owner. 26 (Emphasis and citations omitted)
The principle referred above is known as the beneficial use principle which traces its origin from Section 234 (a) of the Local Government Code. The said provision exempts properties owned by the Republic from real estate taxes, save in cases where its beneficial use has been granted to a taxable person. In such cases, the unpaid taxes shall be chargeable to the taxable person who enjoys actual or beneficial use or possession of the realty property regardless of whether or not it is the owner thereof. 27
The disposition in Philippine Heart Center v. Local Government of Quezon City 28 is on point. In that case, We said that it is the ""taxable person"" with beneficial use who shall be responsible for payment of real property taxes due on government properties. Any remedy for the collection of taxes should then be directed against the ""taxable person,"" the same being an action in personam.
Petitioner, nonetheless, cites this Court's ruling in City of Pasig v. Republic of the Philippines, 29 quoting as follows:
Section 234 (a) of Republic Act No. 7160 states that properties owned by the Republic of the Philippines are exempt from real property tax ""except when the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person."" Thus, the portions of the properties not leased to taxable entities are exempt from real estate tax while the portions of the properties leased to taxable entities are subject to real estate tax. The law imposes the liability to pay real estate tax on the Republic of the Philippines for the portions of the properties leased to taxable entities. It is, of course, assumed that the Republic of the Philippines passes on the real estate tax as part of the rent to the lessees. 30 (Emphasis in the original, underscoring supplied)
Significantly, petitioner's appreciation of Our ruling in the City of Pasig is less than accurate. In said case, We stressed the import of Section 234 (a) of Republic Act No. 7160 in that ""properties owned by the Republic of the Philippines are exempt from real property tax ""except when the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person"". 31 As We explained in Philippine Heart Center, ""the Republic and its instrumentalities x x x retain their exempt status despite leasing out their properties to private individuals."" 32 This exemption comes from its character as a government entity. But the moment beneficial use of the property owned by the government instrumentality is granted to a taxable person, the tax exemption is lifted and the liability to pay falls on the beneficial user or possessor. 33
In the more recent case of Estampador v. City of Manila, 34 We distinguished who between the property owner and the beneficial user the tax liability falls. Citing once again the case of Philippine Heart Center, We reiterated that it is the taxable person with the beneficial use who shall be responsible for the payment of real property taxes due on government properties. 35 Since tax collection is a personal action, the tax authority should go after the taxable person.
Here, as correctly pointed out by the CTA En Banc, the tax exemption, which the owners of LPHI carry, is withdrawn the moment the beneficial use or possession over the real property was granted to petitioner, a taxable entity. From then on, tax liability accrued and the corresponding duty for the payment of the real property tax devolved on petitioner as the taxable beneficial user and possessor thereof. 36
This notwithstanding, petitioner invokes PMO and PTA's contractual liability under the September 15, 1994 Contract of Lease to enforce the tax liabilities imposed against it by the Tacloban City Government.
While We recognize the existence of the provision in the Lease Contract pertaining to PMO and PTA's assumption of tax liability, such assumption of obligation to pay real property tax does not automatically exonerate petitioner from the burden created by law especially so that the validity of the contractual stipulation of the parties is being questioned before the Regional Trial Court. In this regard, We agree with the CTA En Banc when it said:
Clearly, this Court can only determine the extent of petitioner's real property tax liability for respondent Tacloban City Government in relation to the beneficial use clause under Section 234 (a) of R.A. 7160. The contractual obligations of the parties under the lease agreement concern petitioner and the lessors only. Respondent Tacloban City Government is not privy to the lease contract. 37
In the Resolution dated April 17, 2012, the Court in Division correctly observed that:
It has come to the notice of the Court that there is a proper case pending before the Regional Trial Court of Makati, which is the proper forum to determine the validity and enforceability of the Contract of Lease.
Hence, RTC Makati, and not this Court shall resolve the validity of the contract of lease including the contractual stipulations of the parties.
Indeed, not being a party to the contract and without showing that it had knowledge of the same, the local government of Tacloban City cannot be automatically bound by said agreement.
The first paragraph of Article 1311 provides that contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns and heirs, except in cases where the rights and obligations arising from the contract are not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of law. 38 Under the general principle of relativity of contracts, a contract can only bind the parties who had entered into it or their successors or heirs who have assumed their personality or juridical possession, and that, as a consequence, such contract cannot favor or prejudice a third person, 39 even if he or she is aware of such contract and has acted with knowledge thereof. 40 Stated differently, where there is no privity of contract, there is likewise no obligation or liability to speak about. 41
At any rate, whether circumstances exist to warrant the validity and enforceability of Section 11.04 of the contract is a matter that should be threshed out in the appropriate forum, as one has in fact been filed.
WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated August 22, 2014 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 901 n is AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.

[G.R. No. 209702. March 23, 2022.]
SOCORRO P. CABILAO, petitioner, vs. MA. LORNA Q. TAMPAN, rep. by her Attorney-in-fact JUDITH TAMPAN-MONTINOLA & DANILO TAMPAN, respondents.
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
This Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 seeks to annul the January 31, 2013 Decision 2 and October 3, 2013 Resolution 3 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV. No. 01695, which reversed the September 21, 2007 Decision 4 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Surigao City, Branch 29, in so far as Civil Case No. 4826 is concerned in the consolidated cases docketed as Civil Case Nos. 4818 and 4826.
The Antecedents:
On April 7, 1988, Lorna Tampan-Naldoza (Lorna) purchased a residential house and lot from Socorro Cabilao (Socorro) located at 599 Narciso St., Surigao City (subject property), covered by TCT No. T-59, through a Deed of Absolute Sale of a Residential Land together with a House 5 (Deed of Sale), in the amount of P10,000.00. Since Lorna was in the United States, her mother, Antonieta, purchased the property on her behalf. 6 In 1995, Lorna decided to have TCT No. T-59 registered in her name but she discovered that the owner's duplicate got lost while it was kept by Judith Tampan-Montinola (Judith) in the house. Thereafter, Lorna, through Judith, filed a petition for the issuance of a new owner's duplicate. However, spouses Lapulapu and Lelita (Lelita) Buyser (collectively, spouses Buyser) opposed her petition on the ground that they were in possession of the said title after buying the same from Socorro. Thus, Lorna's petition was dismissed. 7
When Lelita informed Socorro about the petition for the issuance of a new owner's copy of the title, Socorro denied having sold the subject property to Lorna. However, due to the controversy, Socorro repurchased the subject property and the owner's duplicate was surrendered back to her. 8
On April 29, 1996, Lorna and Judith lodged a complaint for declaration of nullity of a pacto de retro sale entered into on January 25, 1995 between Socorro and spouses Buyser. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 4818. 9 HSAcaE
On May 5, 1996, Socorro filed an action for Annulment or Cancellation of Document, Quieting of Title/Recovery of Ownership and Possession, Injunction, and Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order 10 against Lorna and Danilo Tampan, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 4826. She alleged that she was the absolute and registered owner of the subject property covered by TCT No. T-59 which was in her possession. Moreover, on April 18, 1990, she sold the subject property through a pacto de retro sale to Enriqueta Baybayon (Enriqueta) for P89,000.00, and to Lelita on January 25, 1995. During both transactions, she surrendered her owner's copy of TCT No. T-59 to Enriqueta and Lelita. 11
In her Answer, 12 Lorna maintained that she owned the subject property and claimed that Socorro was in full possession of her mental faculties when they signed the Deed of Sale before the notary public, Atty. Ildefonso Mantilla (Atty. Mantilla). Moreover, the document was translated and interpreted by Atty. Mantilla to Socorro in the Surigaonon dialect, which is the dialect she understands. Since Lorna was in the United States, her mother, Antonieta, personally gave the consideration of P10,000.00 to Socorro in the presence of Atty. Mantilla. In the Deed of Sale, Antonieta also signed for and on Lorna's behalf. The true consideration paid was more or less P100,000.00 but the Deed of Sale reflected a lesser amount to avoid a higher payment of taxes. The owner's copy of TCT No. T-59 was stolen by Socorro while she was living in the subject property. 13
On August 23, 1996, the RTC ordered the consolidation of Civil Case Nos. 4818 and 4826. 14
During trial, herein respondents presented Judith, Matilde Flores (Matilde), Atty. Mantilla, Jorge Quano (Jorge), and Reynaldo Tampan (Reynaldo). On the other hand, petitioner presented Enriqueta, Lelita, and Socorro herself.
Judith testified that Lorna purchased the property from Socorro through their mother, Antonieta. Socorro turned over the owner's copy of the TCT to Antonieta, who later own handed it over to Judith when the former left for the United States. Prior to Lorna's purchase of the subject property, she used to live three kilometers away and only transferred in the subject property after its purchase. From the time of the purchase, they have been paying the real estate taxes on the subject property, as well as the utility bills. They also shouldered Socorro's medical check-ups while she was residing with them. Moreover, the transfer of title to the property was not immediately done since the money Lorna sent was only sufficient for the payment of the property. When Lorna sent the money for the transfer of title sometime in 1995, it was also the time when Socorro suddenly left their house without notice and took the owner's copy of the title with her. 15
Atty. Mantilla, the notary public before whom the Deed of Sale was executed, testified that he prepared and notarized the Deed of Sale between Socorro and Lorna. Socorro appeared personally while Antonieta represented Lorna and signed on her behalf. The execution of the sale was witnessed by a certain Roque Miole, legal aid from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), and Maria Pecante, his office staff. Socorro handed over a photocopy of the title to Antonieta and the latter gave Socorro P10,000.00. 16 caITAC
Reynaldo confirmed that it was his sister Lorna who bought the subject property, and he accompanied Antonieta to the notary public during the execution of the Deed of Sale. The real consideration of the property is P100,000.00 but only P10,000.00 was declared in order to lessen the payment of taxes. The following day, Socorro gave to his mother the owner's copy of TCT No. T-59. 17
Another witness, Matilde, worked as a laundrywoman for the Tampans. 18 Meanwhile, Jorge lived in the subject property for quite some time. 19 Both witnesses testified that Socorro sold the subject property to Lorna. 20
On the other hand, Enriqueta testified that the subject property was sold to her by Socorro through a pacto de retro sale for P89,000.00. As guarantee, Socorro gave her the owner's copy of TCT No. T-59. She gave the money to Socorro, who in turn handed it over to Danilo Tampan (Danilo) since the latter asked help from Socorro for his construction business. Danilo and his father, Felicisimo, accompanied Socorro and signed as witnesses during the transaction. It took three years before Socorro was able to redeem the property. Moreover, it was Danilo who made the partial payments and the balance was paid by Socorro after the latter found out that the whole amount had not been paid. 21
Lelita testified that the subject property was sold to her by Socorro through a pacto de retro sale and the owner's copy of TCT No. T-59 was also surrendered to her. She and her husband opposed the petition for the issuance of a new owner's copy of the title filed by Lorna. Eventually, Socorro redeemed the property and Lelita returned the owner's copy of the title of the property. 22
Lastly, Socorro denied the sale of the property in favor of Lorna. 23 The Tampans would let her sign various documents whenever she borrowed money and claimed that the alleged Deed of Sale is one of those documents. It was Danilo and Felicisimo who requested her to mortgage the subject property to Enriqueta since Danilo needed funds for his construction business. They even promised to redeem the property. The Tampans paid for the utility bills of the house. 24
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:
In its September 21, 2007 Decision, 25 the RTC dismissed Civil Case No. 4818 considering that Socorro had already repurchased the property from Lelita and the latter already returned the owner's copy of TCT No. T-59. Thus, the action for nullity of the pactro de retro sale had already become moot and academic.
As to Civil Case No. 4826, the RTC declared the Deed of Sale between Socorro and Lorna as null and void. It held that since TCT No. T-59 is under the name of Socorro, it was evidence of indefeasible title to the property. Moreover, the title was in Socorro's possession which is contrary to the regular course of business, if indeed it was sold to Lorna. The Deed of Sale between Lorna and Socorro is unenforceable considering that Lorna did not sign the document as she was in the United States at that time. While Antonieta signed on her behalf, there was nothing on record to prove that Lorna authorized her mother to transact on her behalf. The price of P10,000.00 is grossly inadequate thereby rendering the contract questionable. Lastly, the RTC pointed out that it took Lorna seven years before transferring the title to her name for no valid reason. Hence, the timing was suspicious since Lorna wanted to transfer the title of the property in her name while Socorro was away. 26
The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court finds in favor of Socorro Cabilao.
Civil Case No. 4818 praying for the declaration of the Pacto de Retro Sale entered between defendants as void; and for the spouses Buyser to deliver to the plaintiffs TCT No. T-59 had been rendered moot and academic and is hereby DISMISSED.
Under Civil Case No. 4826, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the ""Deed of Absolute Sale of a Residential Land Together with a House"" dated April 7, 1988 null and void. Socorro Cabilao is hereby confirmed as the lawful owner of the subject real properties. And Lorna Q. Tampan-Montinola and Danilo Q. Tampan and any and all persons claiming any right over the property through them are hereby ordered to surrender possession of the subject properties peacefully to Socorro Cabilao.
No pronouncement as to costs.
SO ORDERED. 27
Aggrieved, respondents filed an appeal. 28
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
In its January 31, 2013 Decision, 29 the CA reversed the RTC's findings. It held that while the Torrens title is evidence of indefeasible title over the property, the execution of a deed of sale of such property transfers the ownership thereof to the buyer even if the same remains under the name of the seller or registered owner. Since Socorro assails the validity of the Deed of Sale to Lorna, she has the burden of proving its invalidity. However, Socorro failed to substantiate her claim that the Tampans employed fraud and deception in securing her signature on the Deed of Sale. The Tampans were paying for the realty taxes over the property, thereby indicating strong evidence of ownership. 30 TCAScE
The CA further held that the Deed of Sale between Socorro and Lorna, being a notarized document, bears evidentiary weight with respect to its due execution and enjoys a presumption of regularity. As to the gross inadequacy of the consideration, the CA ruled that it does not affect the validity of the sale. Likewise, it held that the late or non-registration of a deed of sale does not affect its validity. 31
The fallo of the CA Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated September 21, 2007 issued by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 29, Surigao City is hereby MODIFIED in that as to Civil Case No. 4826, the same is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the Complaint for [""]Annulment or Cancellation of Document, Quieting of Title/Recovery of Ownership and Possession, Injunction, and Damages with prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order"" filed by appellee Socorro Cabilao is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED. 32
Socorro sought reconsideration 33 but it was denied by the CA in its October 3, 2013 Resolution. 34
Hence, the present petition. 35 Socorro maintains that she never sold the subject property to Lorna or any of the latter's representatives. As an illiterate person, she claims that she does not understand English and while the purported deed of sale bears her signature, the same was obtained through fraud by the Tampans in the guise of signing loan documents whenever she borrowed money. Thus, she contends that the Deed of Sale is a simulated contract or one tainted with fraud and therefore null and void. 36
Socorro further claims that her possession over the owner's duplicate copy of the TCT is inconsistent with any intention to convey ownership to another. The property had been the subject of two pacto de retro sales which shows that she clearly had possession over the owner's copy of the title. She points out that if the sale of the subject property indeed transpired, respondents did not take the necessary steps to register the property in their name for almost seven years. 37
In their Comment, 38 respondents argue that Socorro has the burden of proving the existence of fraud which she failed to discharge. Socorro already admitted the genuineness of her signature in the Deed of Sale. However, aside from her bare assertion, Socorro's claim of the existence of fraud remains unsubstantiated. More importantly, the Deed of Sale was notarized. Hence, it carried the presumption of its due execution. As to the claim of gross inadequacy of price and non-registration of the deed of sale, respondents contend that it does not affect the validity of a contract of sale.
Both parties also filed their respective memoranda. 39
Issue
The issue for resolution before the Court is whether the Deed of Sale between Lorna and Socorro is valid.
Our Ruling
We find the petition unmeritorious.
The present controversy hinges on the validity of the Deed of Sale between Lorna and Socorro, which however is a question of fact. 40 It is well-settled that questions of fact are not reviewable in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. As a general rule, this Court is not duty-bound to analyze again and weigh the evidence introduced in and considered by the courts below. 41 Factual findings of the lower courts, if supported by substantial evidence, are accorded great respect and even finality by this Court unless the case falls under any of the exceptions such as when the findings are contrary to those of the trial court. 42 In the case at bar, the CA's factual findings are contrary to those of the RTC. Hence, this Court is called upon to reevaluate the factual findings below.
After a judicious review of the records of the case, We sustain the findings of the CA and uphold the validity of the Deed of Sale between Lorna and Socorro.
Article 1305 of New Civil Code (NCC) provides that a contract is ""a meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service."" The essential requisites are: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) cause of the obligation which is established. In the present case, all the elements of a valid contract are present. In the case at bar, the Deed of Sale validly transferred the ownership over TCT No. T-59 from Socorro to Lorna in consideration of P10,000.00. Arguing the absence of consent on her part, Socorro claims that the Deed of Sale is null and void since her signature thereon was obtained through fraud, or under the guise of a contract of loan. However, the evidence on record belies her theory. cHDAIS
Reynaldo testified that he was present during the execution of the Deed of Sale where he witnessed Antonieta and Socorro sign the document. He further testified that Socorro gave Antonieta the owner's duplicate copy of the title the following day. 43
More importantly, Atty. Mantilla, who prepared and notarized the Deed of Sale, testified and categorically stated that Socorro signed the Deed of Sale and received the consideration of P10,000.00 from Antonieta. At that instance, Socorro handed over a photocopy of the duplicate copy of the title to Antonieta. When asked why Socorro only handed over a photocopy of the TCT, she answered that the duplicate copy was still with a certain Leon Danaque because of her outstanding loan with him. 44
It is a well-settled rule that a duly notarized document enjoys the prima facie presumption of authenticity and due execution, as well as the full faith and credence attached to a public instrument. 45 Thus, a party assailing the authenticity and due execution of a notarized document is required to present evidence that is clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant. 46 Here, Socorro failed to overcome this burden. Aside from her self-serving allegation that she did not know that she was signing a Deed of Sale, there is nothing else on record that supports her assertion.
While Socorro claims that she is an illiterate person, she failed to prove this fact. When a party claims that one is unable to read or is otherwise illiterate, and fraud is alleged, a presumption that there is fraud or mistake in obtaining consent of that party arises under Article 1332 of the NCC, which provides:
When one of the parties is unable to read, or if the contract is in a language not understood by him, and mistake or fraud is alleged, the person enforcing the contract must show that the terms thereof have been fully explained to the former.
However, for Article 1332 to be applicable, the contracting party who alleges fraud or vitiated consent must establish the same by full, clear and convincing evidence. 47 The party must show clear and convincing evidence of one's personal circumstances and that he or she is unable to read at the time of execution of the contested contract. 48 Here, there is nothing in Socorro's testimony showing that she cannot read English or that she was illiterate. To the contrary, the pacto de retro sales 49 that she entered into with Enriqueta and Lelita, respectively, indicate that she is able to read, affix her signature, freely give her consent and enter into contracts. Thus, the presumption of fraud did not arise and Socorro had the burden of proving that the Tampans fraudulently secured her signature under the guise of another loan document which she would usually sign whenever she borrowed money. However, she failed to do so. In fact, such purported loan documents were not even offered in evidence.
It is also of no moment that the consideration was in the amount of P10,000.00. Gross inadequacy of price does not affect the validity of a contract of sale, unless it signifies a defect in the consent or that the parties actually intended a donation or some other contract. 50 Inadequacy of cause will not invalidate a contract unless there has been fraud, mistake or undue influence. 51 As earlier stated, fraud was not proven. Hence, the consideration in the amount of P10,000.00 did not invalidate the sale.
We likewise note that the title over the subject property remained under Socorro's name despite the execution of the Deed of Sale. However, this does not also affect the validity of the deed of sale. Transfer of the certificate of title in the name of the buyer and transfer of ownership to the buyer are two different concepts. 52 As correctly held by the CA, between the seller and buyer, ownership is transferred not by the issuance of the new certificate of title in the name of the buyer but by the execution of the instrument of sale in a public document. 53 Article 1498 of the New Civil Code provides that: DHITCc
Art. 1498. When the sale is made through a public instrument, the execution thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the object of the contract, if from the deed the contrary does not appear or cannot clearly be inferred.
Therefore, contrary to Soccoro's assertion, it is of no moment that the title was only registered seven years after the deed of sale was executed. The sale was already perfected upon the execution of the Deed of Sale before Atty. Mantilla. The non-registration of the title was also aptly explained by Judith in that the money given by Lorna, who was in the United States, was only enough for the purchase of the property. Hence, it took some time before the same could be registered and transferred in Lornas's name.
While Socorro was able to enter into pacto de retro sales for being in possession of the owner's duplicate of the TCT, this fact cannot overturn the evidentiary weight of the notarized Deed of Sale in favor of Lorna. In fact, Enriqueta testified that the proceeds of the pacto de retro sale were given to Danilo for his construction company. During cross examination, Soccoro confirmed this and stated that it was Danilo and his dad Felicisimo who requested to mortgage the property. 54 Precisely because the title was still in Socorro's name despite the sale, it is logical to conclude that the Tampans had to ask Socorro to enter into a contract with Enriqueta to borrow money. If indeed the pacto de retro sale was entered into because Danilo borrowed from Socorro as the latter claims, it would have been prudent if the loan was put into writing and presented as evidence. However, such is not the case.
It is also uncontested that the real property taxes are paid by the Tampans. 55 It is a settled rule that tax declarations and realty tax payment of property are not conclusive evidence of ownership, they are nonetheless good indicia of the possession in the concept of owner, for no one in his right mind would be paying taxes for a property that is not in his actual or at least constructive possession. 56 Coupled with the other pieces of respondent's evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the property was indeed sold to Lorna since the Tampans have been living in the property and exercising acts of dominion and control over the property.
As between the testimonies of petitioner and her other witnesses which failed to prove clearly, positively, and convincingly that she did not intend to sell the property, and the testimonial and documentary evidence of respondents, i.e., the notarized Deed of Sale, tax declaration, and tax receipts, the latter evidence prevails. Testimonial evidence is susceptible to fabrication and there is very little room for choice between testimonial evidence and documentary evidence. Thus, in the weighing of evidence, documentary evidence prevails over testimonial evidence. 57 Taking into account the totality of evidence in the present case, this Court is inclined to rule in favor of Lorna.
WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. The January 31, 2013 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 01695 is hereby AFFIRMED.

[G.R. No. 206120. March 23, 2022.]
RAQUEL G. DY BUNCIO, petitioner, vs. LEONTINA SARMENTA RAMOS and FERNANDO RAMOS, respondents.
DECISION
HERNANDO, ** J p:
The instant Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 assails the September 30, 2011 Resolution 2 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 120922, which denied the Petition for Certiorari 3 filed by petitioner Raquel G. Dy Buncio (Buncio) on the ground that she availed of the improper remedy.
Also questioned in the instant Petition is the CA's March 6, 2013 Resolution 4 denying Buncio's Motion for Reconsideration 5 of the assailed CA Decision.
The Antecedents:
The instant case stemmed from a complaint for Accion Reinvindicatoria and Damages filed by Buncio on January 8, 2007 with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cabanatuan City, docketed as Civil Case No. 5302. 6
Buncio claimed that she is a registered co-owner, together with nine others, of a parcel of land with an area of 37,302 square meters, located at San Josef Sur, Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-50156 of the Registry of Deeds of Cabanatuan City. She further alleged that respondents Leontina Sarmenta Ramos (Leontina) and Fernando Ramos (collectively, respondents) are the unlawful and unauthorized possessors of the land who should be directed to vacate the same. 7
On the other hand, respondents asserted that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case because there existed a leasehold agreement between the late Luis de Guzman and Erlina Santos de Guzman (who are the parents of the registered owners of the subject property), with Leontina and her late husband, Hilario Ramos (Hilario). 8 aScITE
Prior to the pre-trial conference, the RTC heard the respective sides of the parties for a preliminary determination of the existence of tenancy. In its January 30, 2008 Order, 9 the RTC initially held that it had jurisdiction over the case since respondents failed to prove the existence of all elements of agricultural tenancy relationship. The relevant portion of the January 30, 2008 Order reads:
From the evidence submitted by the Defendants to prove tenancy, almost all of the requirements set forth by law are present except that defendant Leontina Ramos and the deceased Hilario Ramos had alleged under oath that they were hired helpers in the land of plaintiff, and this overturned all such proof of tenancy being presented by defendant.
xxx xxx xxx
Defendant Leontina Ramos is estopped from questioning now the authenticity of the allegation in the Joint Sworn Statement (Annex ""6-B"" of the Special Affirmative Defenses) that they are mere hired farm helpers of Luis de Guzman and not tenants in the landholding.
xxx xxx xxx
Defendants failed to prove tenancy in this case.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, for lack of merit, the Special Affirmative Defenses incorporated in the Answer is (sic) DENIED and DISMISSED.
xxx xxx xxx. 10
Pre-trial then ensued on February 20, 2008. During the proceedings, or on November 19, 2009, the RTC motu proprio conducted an ocular inspection of the subject property. 11
Subsequently, on May 31, 2010, Buncio filed her formal offer of documentary evidence to which respondents objected. 12 Furthermore, respondents filed a motion with the RTC and reiterated their claim to refer the case to DAR, asserting that they are tenants-lessees of the subject land. 13
In its assailed October 28, 2010 Resolution, the RTC referred the case to the DAR, citing Section 50-A of Republic Act No. (RA) 6657, 14 as amended by RA 9700, 15 which provides:
Section 50-A. — Exclusive Jurisdiction on Agrarian Dispute. — No court or prosecutor's office shall take cognizance of cases pertaining to the implementation of the CARP except those provided under Section 57 of Republic Act No. 6657, as amended. If there is an allegation from any of the parties that the case is agrarian in nature and one of the parties is a farmer, farmworker, or tenant, the case shall be automatically referred by the judge or the prosecutor to the DAR which shall determine and certify within fifteen (15) days from referral whether an agrarian dispute exists: Provided, that from the determination of the DAR, an aggrieved party shall have judicial recourse x x x. 16
The RTC held that based on the ocular inspection and proceedings conducted by the court, it found that the entire area of 3.7302 hectares is devoted to palay production and traversed by a cemented City Road of Cabanatuan City. 17 Thus, the trial court referred the case to the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) since there was an allegation of landowner-tenant relationship between the parties. The RTC pointed out that the foregoing provision has granted the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) special and original authority to hear and adjudicate cases involving agrarian disputes. 18 HEITAD
On December 2, 2010, Buncio filed an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration 19 of the RTC's October 28, 2010 Resolution which the trial court denied in its June 6, 2011 Order, the relevant portion of which reads:
For resolution is the Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated October 28, 2010, For Suspension of Transmittal of Records to DARAB x x x filed by plaintiff x x x.
It could be recalled that plaintiff was given the opportunity to comment x x x to Refer the Case to DAR under Sec. 19, R.A. 9700, with Implementing Rules. In fact, the plaintiff's Opposition was submitted to this Court on October 11, 2010.
The issues raised in the Omnibus Motion are mere reiteration of the issues alleged in their Comment/Opposition to the defendant's Motion to Refer said case to the DARAB prior to the Court's Resolution dated October 28, 2010. x x x
In the interest of justice and for the speedy disposition of the above captioned case and for lack of merit, the Omnibus Motion is hereby DENIED.
WHEREFORE, let the records of this case be forwarded to the DAR for the necessary determination and certification.
SO ORDERED. 20
Aggrieved with the RTC's ruling, Buncio filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA assailing the RTC's October 28, 2010 Resolution and its June 6, 2011 Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration thereof.
In the meantime, the case was set for hearing on August 4, 2011 before the Provincial Adjudicator of DARAB, Region III. Buncio, through her counsel, entered a special appearance and manifested that she was not submitting herself to the jurisdiction of the DARAB in view of her position that jurisdiction is with the trial court per the RTC's January 30, 2008 Order. 21
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
In its September 30, 2011 Resolution, the CA dismissed the petition. The relevant portion of its ruling reads:
In the instant case, petitioner was not without any plain, speedy, or adequate remedy as her cause could very well be adequately advanced before the DAR. And even assuming that the outcome of the case in [the] aforesaid department would be adverse to petitioner, she is not precluded from elevating the case on appeal before this Court, and even all the way up to the Supreme Court. As such, resort to a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules at this stage is very much premature.
xxx xxx xxx
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the petition is hereby DISMISSED.
SO ORDERED. 22
Buncio moved for reconsideration but it was denied by the CA in its March 6, 2013 Resolution. 23
Displeased, Buncio filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari.
Issue
The pivotal issue herein is whether or not the CA correctly dismissed Buncio's Petition for Certiorari. ATICcS
Our Ruling
The instant Petition is devoid of merit.
The CA correctly dismissed Buncio's Petition for Certiorari for being a wrong remedy. Clearly, Buncio had other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy before the DAR.
Section 50-A of RA 6557, as amended by RA 9700, expressly provides that ""if there is an allegation from any of the parties that the case is agrarian in nature and one of the parties is a farmer, farmworker, or tenant, the case shall be automatically referred by the judge or the prosecutor to the DAR which shall determine and certify within fifteen (15) days from referral whether an agrarian dispute exists: Provided, that from the determination of the DAR, an aggrieved party shall have judicial recourse."" Hence, the proper recourse of Buncio upon the trial court's referral of the case to await the DARAB's resolution. Thereafter, Buncio can assail the determination of the DARAB by appeal to the CA. Plainly, her immediate recourse to the CA via a Petition for Certiorari was improper and thus, correctly struck down by the appellate court.
Buncio primarily argues that prior to the RTC's assailed October 28, 2010 Resolution and June 6, 2011 Order, the trial court issued a January 30, 2008 Order ruling that it had jurisdiction over the case because respondents failed to prove the existence of all requisites of the existence of tenancy relationship which would divest it of its jurisdiction. 24 Thus, Buncio argues that she already acquired a vested right on said finding such that it may no longer be set aside by a subsequent ruling such as the RTC's assailed October 28, 2010 Resolution. 25 Furthermore, she asserts that RA 9700 and DAR Administrative Order No. (AO) 04, Series of 2009 may not be given retroactive application by the trial court and impair the vested right she acquired by virtue of the RTC's January 30, 2008 Order. 26
We disagree.
Rule 45 of the Rules of Court
covers only questions of law.
At the outset, We point out that the instant petition asks for a factual review of the case, an issue beyond the purview of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which covers only questions of law. The core issue of whether there was a tenancy relationship between the parties so as to divest the RTC of its jurisdiction in favor of the DAR is mainly factual in nature. In Ligtas v. People, 27 We underscored that ""[t]o be precise, however, the existence of a tenancy relationship is a legal conclusion based on facts presented corresponding to the statutory elements of tenancy."" The instant petition has not demonstrated why this case falls among the exceptions as to warrant a review of the factual findings of the trial court.
Buncio did not acquire any vested
right on the RTC's January 30,
2008 Order.
Settled is the rule that jurisdiction over the subject matter is ""conferred only by the Constitution or the law. It cannot be acquired through a waiver or enlarged by the omission of the parties or conferred by the acquiescence of the court."" 28 Consequently, contrary to Buncio's claim, We hold that she did not acquire any vested right from the January 30, 2008 Order, if subsequently during the trial court's proceedings, it became apparent that the case should be properly referred to the DAR which has the jurisdiction over the subject matter or issues raised. TIADCc
In Mendoza v. Germino, Jr., 29 which was likewise cited 30 by petitioner herein and in Velasquez v. Spouses Cruz, 31 We pointed out that the trial court is duty-bound to conduct a preliminary conference and, if necessary, to receive evidence to determine if such tenancy relationship had, in fact, been shown to be the real issue. If it is shown during the hearing or conference that, indeed, tenancy is the issue, the trial court should dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.
Relevantly, in the fairly recent case of Dayrit v. Norquillas. 32 We held that:
The amended CARL adds that the judge or prosecutor shall automatically refer the case to the DAR if there is an allegation from any of the parties that the case is agrarian in nature, and one of the parties is a farmer, farmworker or tenant. 33
In the instant case, We find that the RTC correctly referred the case to the DAR in view of the respondents' allegation of a tenancy relationship.
The DARAB has jurisdiction to
adjudicate an agrarian dispute.
We note that the core issue herein is which between the RTC and the DAR has jurisdiction over the case. An accion reinvindicatoria is an action to recover ownership over real property, 34 the jurisdiction of which is within the proper RTC. 35 On the other hand, Section 50 of RA 6657 and Section 17 of Executive Order No. (EO) 229 36 vested upon the DAR primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters, as well as original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform. Subsequently, EO 129-A 37 was issued wherein the power to adjudicate agrarian reform cases was transferred to the DARAB, and jurisdiction over the implementation of agrarian reform was delegated to the DAR regional offices. 38
We underscore that even prior to RA 9700 and DAR AO 04, Series of 2009 which Buncio argues should not have been given retroactive effect as to set aside the RTC's January 30, 2008 Order, the following similar provisions of RA 6657 and the 2003 DARAB Rules of Procedure were already in place upon the filing of her January 8, 2007 Complaint, the provisions of which indicate that it is the DARAB that has jurisdiction to adjudicate an agrarian dispute, 39 to wit:
Section 50 of R.A. No. 6657 provides:
Section 50. Quasi-Judicial Powers of the DAR. — The DAR is hereby vested with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).
Rule II, Section 1 (1.1) of the DARAB 2003 Rules of Procedure:
RULE II
Jurisdiction of the Board and its Adjudicators
SECTION 1. Primary and Exclusive Original Jurisdiction. — The Adjudicator shall have primary and exclusive original jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate the following cases:
1.1 The rights and obligations of persons, whether natural or juridical, engaged in the management, cultivation, and use of all agricultural lands covered by Republic Act (RA) No. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), and other related agrarian laws; 40 SDAaTC
An agrarian dispute is defined by Section 3 (d) of R.A. No. 6657 as follows:
(d) Agrarian dispute refers to any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy, stewardship or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes concerning farmworkers' associations or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of such tenurial arrangements.
It includes any controversy relating to compensation of lands acquired under R.A. 6657 and other terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowners to farmworkers, tenants and other agrarian reform beneficiaries, whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of farm operator and beneficiary, landowner and tenant, or lessor and lessee.
In any event, the retroactive application of RA 9700 has long been settled in Chailese Development Company, Inc. v. Dizon. 41
For DARAB to have jurisdiction over the case, there must be a tenancy relationship between the parties. 42
In Velasquez v. Spouses Cruz, 43 We defined tenancy relationship as ""a juridical tie which arises between a landowner and a tenant once they agree, expressly or impliedly, to undertake jointly the cultivation of a land belonging to the landowner, as a result of which relationship the tenant acquires the right to continue working on and cultivating the land.""
As a rule, the existence of a tenancy relationship cannot be presumed and allegations that one is a tenant do not automatically give rise to security of tenure. 44 Thus, in order for tenancy agreement to arise, it is essential to establish all its indispensable elements, viz.:
1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant;
2) the subject matter is agricultural land;
3) there is consent between the parties to the relationship;
4) the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production;
5) there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee; and
6) the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee. 45
All the foregoing requisites are necessary to create a tenancy relationship, and the absence of one or more requisites will not make the alleged tenant a de facto tenant. 46 In Macalanda, Jr. v. Acosta, We emphasized that ""[c]rucial for the creation of tenancy relations would be the existence of two of the essential elements, namely, consent and sharing and/or payment of lease rentals. 47
In the instant case, respondents substantially alleged that there existed a tenancy relationship among the parties, in particular among the parents of Buncio and Hilario in view of their leasehold agreement. Furthermore, respondents' claim that pursuant to said agreement, she and her husband, Hilario, have been paying the agreed rentals of the landholdings, to the lessors or Buncio's parents. 48 These allegations suffice for the referral of the dispute to the DAR. ""As stated by law, mere allegation of an agrarian dispute is enough."" 49
Moreover, even prior to Buncio's complaint or as early as September 23, 2004 this Court has ruled in Department of Agrarian Reform v. Cuenca 50 that ""[a]ll controversies on the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) fall under the jurisdiction of the [DAR], even though they raise questions that are also legal or constitutional in nature. All doubts should be resolved in favor of the DAR, since the law has granted it special and original authority to hear and adjudicate agrarian matters.""
At this juncture, We find it apropos to restate our recent ruling in Dayrit v. Norquillas 51 which clarified the jurisdiction of the DARAB and the trial courts, viz.:
Based on the foregoing, David and Chailese can be viewed as guides for the courts in tackling ejectment and possessory actions allegedly involving agrarian disputes. David instructs that not all ejectment cases are cognizable by the first-level courts — those involving agrarian disputes are not cognizable by the first-level courts. In this relation, Chailese clarifies the requisites for an agrarian dispute, and highlights the mandate of the amendatory law of automatic referral of cases involving agrarian disputes to the DAR. 52
WHEREFORE, the instant Petition is DENIED. The assailed September 30, 2011 Resolution and March 6, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 120922 are hereby AFFIRMED.

ANITA SANTOS,petitioner,vs. ATTY. KISSACK B. GABAEN, RICARDO D. SANGA, AND THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES,respondents.
DECISION
J.Y. LOPEZ, J p:
Before this Court is a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition 1 with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Anita Santos (Santos) against respondents Atty. Kissack B. Gabaen (Gabaen), Ricardo D. Sanga, and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIPs), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) assailing the Order 2 dated February 7, 2011, and the Cease and Desist Order 3 dated February 10, 2011 of the NCIP-Regional Hearing Office (NCIP-RHO).
The Antecedents
Pinagtibukan It Pala'wan, Inc. (PINPAL) is a people's organization of Pala'wan Indigenous Cultural Community in Barangay Punta Baja, Rizal, Palawan. It is the holder of Resource Use Permit (RUP) No. 001-09, 4 which authorizes it to occupy, cut, collect, and remove 155,503.125 kilos of almaciga resin from the Certificates of Ancestral Domain Claims (CADC) area with CADC No. R4-CADC-100 located in the said barangay.Since time immemorial, Danny Erong (Erong),a Pala'wan Tribal Chieftain of Purok Culapisan, Barangay Punta Baja, Rizal, Palawan, and his ancestors have been engaged in the gathering and selling of almaciga resin within the forest area. 5
Erong alleged that the DENR, through the City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) of Quezon, Palawan, granted PINPAL's RUP No. 001-09 6 without the required Certification Precondition (CP) under Section 59 7 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8371. 8 Under this provision, all departments and government agencies are required to secure prior certification from the NCIP stating that the area affected does not overlap with an ancestral domain or that the Free and Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) of the affected Indigenous Cultural Community (ICC) or Indigenous Peoples (IPs) has been obtained before any concession, license, or permit is granted. 9
Erong further claimed that PINPAL, as the holder of RUP No. 001-09, required him to sell his almaciga resin only to Santos, thereby allowing her to have monopoly over the market. 10 When Erong found another buyer offering a better price than that given by Santos, he pleaded to PINPAL that he be allowed to gather and sell resin to his buyer of choice. However, PINPAL allegedly refused and even threatened to confiscate his almaciga resin and prohibited him from gathering and selling the same. 11 Hence, on October 15, 2010, Erong filed a complaint 12 before the NCIP-RHO against PINPAL, represented by Naron T. Asura (Asura), and the DENR. Erong accused PINPAL and DENR of violating Section 59 of R.A. No. 8371 in issuing RUP No. 001-09. 13
On October 20, 2010, the NCIP-RHO Regional Hearing Officer Gabaen issued a 20-day TRO. 14 CAIHTE
On November 17, 2010, Santos filed a Verified Motion to Intervene 15 and her Answer-in-Intervention. 16 She denied monopolizing the market. She explained that though she buys the products of PINPAL, she does not exclusively fix the price because it is controlled by market demand. 17 She also stressed that she does not buy directly from the members of the ICC but from PINPAL's authorized representative. 18 She also maintained that Erong failed to demonstrate irreparable injury to justify the issuance of an injunction. 19
On December 2, 2010, the NCIP-RHO conducted a hearing wherein the parties expressed their willingness to enter into an amicable settlement. 20 Therefore, in an Order 21 issued on even date, the case was remanded to the Tribal Council of the Pala'wan ICC for the expeditious settlement of the dispute based on the customs and traditions of the Pala'wan Tribe. 22
While a general assembly for the amicable settlement was scheduled on February 4, 2011, PINPAL advised the NCIP-RHO that it was no longer willing to proceed with the proposed amicable settlement, and that they will not participate in the general assembly, 23 thus, leaving the issues to be resolved by the NCIP-RHO. 24
Subsequently, the general assembly proceeded as scheduled. Despite the boycott made by PINPAL, community members supporting Erong and other PINPAL officers and members attended. However, no resolution was reached, giving way to another assembly set on February 14, 2011. 25
On February 7, 2011, the NCIP-RHO received a call from its Field Office based in Abo-Abo, Sofronio, Palawan, reporting that a van coming from Punta Baja, Rizal will be used by PINPAL, particularly Asura, and will surreptitiously transport a full-load of almaciga resin out of the ancestral domain. Hence, NCIP-RHO directed the NCIP Community Service Center of Abo-Abo to mobilize the DENR and police checkpoints. However, no police officers nor DENR personnel were available. Thus, the NCIP-RHO sought the assistance of the Philippine Marines to enforce the jurisdiction of the NCIP. 26
The NCIP claimed that since the almaciga resin were going to be brought to Santos in Puerto Prinsesa and will immediately be transported to Manila, waiting for a written restraining order from the NCIP-RHO in Quezon City, Metro Manila was deemed impractical. 27 On the basis of Gabaen's instruction, the NCIP Field Office in Abo-abo, Palawan issued a memorandum 28 dated February 6, 2011 enjoining the transport of the almaciga resin. At 1:30 p.m. on February 7, 2011, the elf truck that Santos sent to pick up the almaciga resin from the warehouse of PINPAL was apprehended by the Philippine Marines on the basis of the memorandum dated February 6, 2011 was shown to Nilo Ybanez, the person driving the truck. 29 The vehicle and almaciga resin were then impounded. 30
Thereafter, in an Order 31 dated February 7, 2011, the NCIP-RHO required the almaciga resin to remain in the custody of the NCIP until the resolution of the complaint and further instructed that they be deposited with the Abo-Abo Service Center. 32 The pertinent portion of the Order states:
xxx xxx xxx
The almaciga resins will remain confiscated by this Quasi-Judicial Court until the resolution of the case pending before it and to be deposited with the Abo-Abo Service Center after the issuance of receipt of the confiscated almaciga.
WHEREFORE,with the foregoing, the NCIP Provincial Officer and the Community Development Officer of the Abo-Abo Service Center are hereby ordered to effect the Jurisdiction of the NCIP. The PNP and the Philippine Marines are ordered by this quasi[-]judicial court to assist the effective jurisdiction of this Office without hesitation.
So ordered. 33 (Emphases in the original)
Subsequently, on February 10, 2011, the NCIP-RHO issued a Cease and Desist Order, 34 the dispositive portion of which states:
WHEREFORE,the defendants, PINAGTIBUKAN IT PALA'WAN (PINPAL),Represented by: Naron T Asura and the DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES thru PENRO Juan De La Cruz and his agents namely: Ma Theresa V. Ayson,Chief FMS; Bernardo S. Francisco,Chief FMS; Florencio C. Diaz,CENRO; Jesus Nunez, Jr.,FR./Team Leader Sector III; Rosvianne Ybanez,owner of conveyance; Nilo Ybanez,representative; Jeffry Cinco,owner/shipper; Merlo Cantuba,FR/Team Leader Sector II; Gerry O. Pader,Forest Ranger Marlo B. Morano,Forest ranger; Froilan Felix,DENR manning the abo-abo checkpoint; Police Officer Willy Molines; Brgy. Capt. Myrna Marques; Anita Santos and all those who claim rights under said defendants and all persons under their instructions and acting for and in their behalves are hereby ordered to stay, refrain or CEASE and DESIST from further COERCING, INTIMIDATING AND THREATENING the NCIP employee of AboAbo who effected the seizure of the illegal forest products unlawfully taken from the ancestral domain and INTERVENING into the release of the seized almaciga.
And for all the employees of the DENR Palawan, specifically, to cease and desist in intervening and disregarding the law and the jurisdiction of the NCIP over all ancestral domains and all the natural resources and forest products illegally transported without a CP or without going into the legal mandatory process of FPIC.
Further, the defendant DENR thru the PENRO and all its CENROs in Palawan to FURTHER CEASE AND DESIST IN IMPLEMENTING ALL ILLEGALY * ISSUED RESOURCE USE PERMITS GRANTED ALL OVER THE ANCESTRAL DOMAINS WITHIN PALAWAN AND FOR ANITA SANTOS, JEFFRY CINCO, NILO YBANEZ AND ROSEVIANNE * YBANES, WHOSE RIGHTS AS CONCESSIONERS, BUYERS AND SHIPPERS OF ALMACIGA EMANTED FROM AN ILLEGAL ISSUANCE OF RUPs, TO ABSOLUTELY STAY AND REFRAIN FROM CONTINUING TO USE AN ILLEGALY n OBTAINED RIGHT.
Finally, the Government thru the NCIP as the GUARDIAN OF THE PEOPLE are hereby ordered to gather the General Assembly of the ancestral Domain subject matter of this complaint and facilitate the election of a legitimate tribal leaders/constitute legal Indigenous Peoples Organization and register it with the NCIP in order for it to have a legal standing in dealing with all matters pertaining to the ancestral domain.
The private defendants are hereby ordered to submit all the financial statements of their 20 years of operation as an alleged IP organization with the Regional Hearing Office to check if indeed the proceeds of the almaciga went to the benefit of the whole ancestral domain subject matter of the complaint.
The driver of the truck van, Nilo Ybanez, with plate no. RGK 643, used to transport the illegally acquired almaciga is hereby directly ordered by this Regional Hearing Office to open his truck in order for the NCIP to fully effect its jurisdiction over the almaciga resins within three (3) days from the receipt or refusal to receive of this order. Refusal to comply with this order is contempt under the rules and the NCIP with the help of the marines may be allowed to open the truck on their own initiative to consummate the seizure.
This CEASE AND DESIST ORDER shall be effective immediately.
Violation of this order will subject the violator to not more than six (6) months in prison or a fine not exceeding Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) and will be ordered to make full restitution of the property involved or such amount as may be alleged and proved.
Ordering further the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIPs) in Abo-Abo Service Center in Palawan to immediately serve this order to the defendants and agents of the defendants on the field.
Commending the Philippine Marines under the command of Col. Jesus Raul Valdes for its continued assistance to the NCIP in effecting its jurisdiction.
The Municipal Government and the Municipal Chief of Police of Rizal, Palawan are advised to give due assistance to the NCIP in the service of this order so as to avoid the risk of life and security as per the joint memorandum of agreement between the DILG and the NCIP respecting the rights of the Indigenous Peoples.
So ordered.35 (Emphases and italics in the original)
Based on the Cease and Desist Order, 36 the NCIP-RHO enjoined the parties from coercing, threatening, and intimidating the NCIP personnel and from intervening in the release of the almaciga resin. The DENR and the CENRO were called out for issuing the RUP for the almaciga resins and consenting to their removal from the ancestral domains of the IPs without the requisite certification under Section 59 of R.A. No. 8371. 37 DETACa
On February 15, 2011, Santos filed with the NCIP-RHO a notice of withdrawal of the Motion to Intervene, which she filed on November 17, 2010, stating that the proceedings in the case lack due process and that the almaciga resin were being held without jurisdiction. 38 Thereafter, Santos filed a Petition for Certiorari and prohibition 39 with prayer for the issuance of TRO with this Court.
Similarly, Asura, representing PINPAL, filed an omnibus motion with the NCIP-RHO asking for the same reliefs Santos prayed for in her petition. 40
Just a few weeks after, the leaders of the tribes affected by the Cease and Desist Order asked that it be lifted and that they be allowed to transport their minor forest products out of their ancestral domain. 41
In another Order 42 dated April 5, 2011, the NCIP-RHO directed the lifting of the Cease and Desist Order against the DENR. Nonetheless, the NCIP-RHO stressed that in issuing certificate of origins, the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Officer (PENRO)/CENRO must abide by the mandatory rule on FPIC. The NCIP-RHO reminded that a certificate issued by the NCIP Provincial Officer should first be obtained stating that the requirement of FPIC has been complied with by the grantees before certificate of origins may be issued. 43
Meanwhile, on April 25, 2011, Rosvianne S. Ybanez, claiming to be the daughter of Santos, filed a third party claim 44 with the NCIP-RHO. She asked for the release of her seized van that was used to transport the almaciga resins. Her claim was granted and the van was released to her father, Nilo Ybanez, the common-law husband of Santos. 45
In the present Petition for Certiorari and prohibition, 46 Santos asks this Court inter alia to: (1) issue a TRO and a writ of prohibition to enjoin Gabaen, the NCIP, the DENR, and all persons acting under its authority from implementing the Cease and Desist Order dated February 10, 2011; (2) issue a TRO and a writ of prohibition to enjoin Gabaen and the NCIP from ruling on the validity of the RUP in NCIP Case No. 28-RIV-10 during the pendency of the petition; (3) annul the Order dated February 7, 2011 and the Cease and Desist Order dated February 10, 2011 for lack of jurisdiction and for being contrary to law; and (4) declare unconstitutional Section 3 (a) 47 of R.A. No. 8371, and Section 1, Part II, Rule III 48 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 8371 for violating Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution. 49
For the government, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) deemed it appropriate to file a Comment 50 stating that: (1) Santos has no standing to institute the petition as she is not the owner of the RUP whose validity is in question; 51 (2) the present petition is not the proper remedy to question the validity of the orders Gabaen issued; 52 (3) the NCIP has jurisdiction to issue the assailed orders pursuant to its quasi-judicial power under Section 69 (d) of R.A. No. 8371; 53 (4) even if the case may be resolved without passing upon the constitutionality of R.A. No. 8371, the resolution of such issue presents a justiciable controversy and is imperative in order to finally settle the issue and avoid a situation wherein all RUPs are resolved on the basis of the application of the doctrine of operative fact; 54 (5) the provisions of R.A. No. 8371 conferring ownership over ancestral domains and lands to IPs contravene the Regalian Doctrine; 55 and (6) the RUP of PINPAL is invalid due to non-compliance with Section 59 of R.A. No. 8371 regardless of the constitutionality of the relevant provisions, since the doctrine of operative fact recognizes that any legislative or executive act, prior to its invalidity, is considered to be in force and must be complied with. 56
For its part, the NCIP argues that: (1) it has acted within the scope of its jurisdiction and with due process in the issuance of the Order dated February 7, 2011 and the Cease and Desist Order dated February 10, 2011; 57 (2) the NCIP can validly question the RUP issued by the DENR with respect to natural resources found within the ancestral domain; 58 (3) ICCs/IPs are not exempt from the requirement of obtaining FPIC from the community and the corresponding CP from the NCIP before a RUP can be issued to them by the DENR for utilizing natural resources within the ancestral domain; 59 (4) Santos cannot collaterally attack the constitutionality of R.A. No. 8371 in the present case as it is immaterial to the causes of action she raised; 60 and (5) the petition should be dismissed on technical grounds for raising to this Court issues other than those on pure questions of law, and for failing to exhaust all prior remedies. 61
By way of Reply, 62 Santos insists that: (1) she has locus standi to file the present petition because her business was affected by the assailed orders and she is the owner of the confiscated almaciga resins; 63 (2) a petition for certiorari and prohibition was the appropriate remedy and that the principle on exhaustion of administrative remedies is not applicable, since she was not even made a party to any pending case before the NCIP; 64 (3) her challenge on the constitutionality of Section 3 (a) of R.A. No. 8371, and Section 1, Part II, Rule III of the IRR of R.A. No. 8371 was proper because ownership of the natural resources determines which agency has jurisdiction to take cognizance of the issues on the validity of the RUP; 65 (4) the validity of the RUP is not an issue in this petition as the underlying issue is the ownership of ancestral domain; 66 and (5) the status quo that must be maintained is the continued trading of almaciga resins by PINPAL and Santos. 67
After several extensions afforded by this Court to the DENR, it filed its Comment 68 on August 25, 2020. It maintains that: (1) the RUP it issued is valid and is in line with its duties and responsibilities; 69 (2) the NCIP does not have jurisdiction to invalidate the RUP DENR issued; 70 and (3) the provisions in R.A. No. 8371 conferring right of ownership over ancestral domains are unconstitutional as it contravenes the Regalian Doctrine. 71 aDSIHc
Issues
The issues to be resolved are:
I
Whether the present petition is the proper remedy to question the orders of Gabaen;
II
Whether Santos has legal standing to defend the validity of the RUP issued by the DENR to PINPAL; and
III
Whether this Court may take cognizance and rule on the constitutionality of the provisions of R.A. No. 8371 conferring ownership over ancestral domain and land to ICCs/IPs.
Our Ruling
The petition must be dismissed.
I
At the outset, there is a need to discuss the propriety of the petition for certiorari and prohibition filed with the objective of annulling the challenged orders of Gabaen that were issued in the exercise of the NCIP's quasi-judicial power.
Under Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the following requisites must be present in order for a petition for certiorari to prosper: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board, or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board, or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. 72
Meanwhile, in Section 2, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the following requisites must be established in the case of a petition for prohibition: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, corporation, board or person exercising functions, judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial; (2) such tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion; and (3) there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. 73
In the present case, the first two requisites for a petition for certiorari and prohibition under Rule 65 are present because it is directed against orders of the NCIP issued in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and are purportedly without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion. The third requisite — that there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law — is likewise present. To demonstrate this requisite within the context of the present case, it is imperative to discuss the mandate and jurisdiction of the NCIP.
The NCIP is mandated to ""protect and promote the interest and well-being of the ICCs/IPs with due regard to their beliefs, customs, traditions and institutions."" 74 This is consistent with the framework observed by the State in favor of the protection of the rights of the ICCs/IPs, as found in Section 22, Article II, 75 Section 5, Article XII, 76 and Section 6, Article XIII 77 of the Constitution. In The City Government of Baguio City v. Atty. Masweng,78 this Court declared that:
The NCIP is the primary government agency responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies, plans and programs to protect and promote the rights and well-being of indigenous cultural communities/indigenous peoples (ICCs/IPs) and the recognition of their ancestral domains as well as their rights thereto. In order to fully effectuate its mandate, the NCIP is vested with jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving the rights of ICCs/IPs. The only condition precedent to the NCIP's assumption of jurisdiction over such disputes is that the parties thereto shall have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws and have obtained a certification from the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved. 79
To achieve the mandate of the State, the jurisdiction of the NCIP is laid down in Section 66 of R.A. No. 8371, which states:
SECTION 66. Jurisdiction of the NCIP.— The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs: Provided,however,That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. 80
Likewise, Section 5, Rule III of the NCIP Administrative Circular No. 1, Series of 2003, or the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure Before the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (2003 NCIP Rules of Procedure) provides an enumeration of cases under the jurisdiction of the NCIP: TIADCc
SECTION 5.  Jurisdiction of the NCIP. —The NCIP through its Regional Hearing Offices shall exercise jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs and all cases pertaining to the implementation, enforcement, and interpretation of R.A. 8371, including but not limited to the following:
(1) Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction of the RHO:
a. Cases involving disputes and controversies over ancestral lands/domains of ICCs/IPs;
b. Cases involving violations of the requirement of free and prior and informed consent of ICCs/IPs;
c. Actions for enforcement of decisions of ICCs/IPs involving violations of customary laws or desecration of ceremonial sites, sacred places, or rituals;
d. Actions for redemption/reconveyance under Section 8(b) of R.A. 8371; and
e. Such other cases analogous to the foregoing.
(2) Original Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Office:
a. Cases affecting property rights, claims of ownership, hereditary succession, and settlement of land disputes, between and among ICCs/IPs that have not been settled under customary laws; and
b. Actions for damages arising out of any violation of Republic Act No. 8371.
(3) Exclusive and Original Jurisdiction of the Commission:
a. Petition for cancellation of Certificate of Ancestral Domain Titles/Certificate of Ancestral Land Titles (CADTs/CALTs) alleged to have been fraudulently acquired by, and issued to, any person or community as provided for under Section 54 of R.A. 8371. Provided that such action is filed within one (1) year from the date of registration. 81
Among the powers bestowed on the NCIP is the jurisdiction ""to decide all appeals from the decisions and acts of all various offices with the Commission."" 82 This necessarily includes decisions and acts of the regional and field offices of the NCIP.
However, it must be clarified that the NCIP does not automatically have jurisdiction over all disputes involving ICCs/IPs. In Unduran v. Aberasturi,83 it was declared that Section 66 of R.A. No. 8371 does not confer on the NCIP exclusive and original jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs. This Court emphasized that the proper construction of the provision, particularly its qualifying proviso,is that the NCIP's jurisdiction over such claims and disputes occur ""only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP."" 84
Here, it is undisputed that Santos does not belong to the ICC of Erong and PINPAL. The remedies the NCIP suggested are not available to Santos because she could not file a motion for reconsideration before the NCIP nor an appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA). She has no available remedy within the NCIP as it does not have jurisdiction over her claim. Therefore, a petition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is the proper remedy to challenge the confiscation of the almaciga resins.
Nevertheless, the petition should still be dismissed for violating the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. Under Section 5 (1), Article VIII of the Constitution, this Court has original jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari,prohibition, and mandamus.However, in GIOS-SAMAR, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communications,85 it was held that:
The 1987 Constitution and the Rules of Court promulgated, pursuant to its provisions, granted us original jurisdiction over certain cases. In some instances, this jurisdiction is shared with Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) and the Court of Appeals (CA). However, litigants do not have unfettered discretion to invoke the Court's original jurisdiction. The doctrine of hierarchy of courts dictates that, direct recourse to this Court is allowed only to resolve questions of law, notwithstanding the invocation of paramount or transcendental importance of the action. This doctrine is not mere policy, rather, it is a constitutional filtering mechanism designed to enable the Court to focus on the more fundamental and essential tasks assigned to it by the highest law of the land.86 (Emphasis supplied)
The doctrine of hierarchy of courts is in place to ""ensure that this Court remains a court of last resort."" 87 This Court could not simply give due course to all petitions where original jurisdiction over the matter is shared with the lower courts as it will unnecessarily clog this Court's docket and exhaust resources that may be better utilized to resolve more pressing concerns.
In The Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections,88 this Court identified the instances wherein the strict application of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts may be relaxed. These include: (1) when there are genuine issues of constitutionality that must be addressed at the most immediate time; (2) when the issues involved are of transcendental importance; (3) in cases of first impression; (4) when the constitutional issues raised are better decided by this Court; (5) when the exigency or time element presented in the case cannot be ignored; (6) when the petition filed reviews the act of a constitutional organ; (7) when petitioners have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law; and (8) when the petition includes questions that are dictated by public welfare and the advancement of public policy, or demanded by the broader interest of justice, or the orders complained of were found to be patent nullities, or the appeal was considered as clearly an inappropriate remedy. 89 Under any of these circumstances, a petitioner may be permitted to seek direct resort to this Court through certiorari,mandamus, and/or prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. AIDSTE
To validly take cognizance of the present petition for certiorari and prohibition, Santos must specify the exceptional circumstance present in her case to warrant direct resort to this Court. Noticeably, in justifying her direct resort to this Court, Santos merely alleged that:
xxx xxx xxx
20. Since there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law for the petitioner, a recourse to this Petition was made by her before this Honorable Court. Also, considering the chaotic consequence, magnitude and the extreme urgency of the matter involved in this Petition, only this Honorable Court can provide the immediate and adequate remedy to the situation affecting not only the petitioner but the other traders as well and the indigenous peoples in Palawan. 90
A careful examination of the quoted statement above reveals that Santos failed to invoke any extraordinary circumstance to convince this Court to allow a deviation from the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. Merely stating the purported ""chaotic consequence, magnitude and the extreme urgency of the matter,"" 91 without anything more to substantiate her claim, does not automatically excuse her from observing the hierarchy of courts.
In Puerto Del Sol Palawan, Inc. v. Gabaen (Puerto Del Sol Palawan, Inc.),92 the CA opined that since Puerto Del Sol Palawan, Inc. (PDSPI) had the available remedy of filing a motion for reconsideration against the Order of the NCIP-RHO dismissing outright its Memorandum on Appeal for being filed beyond the reglementary period, the petition for certiorari of PDSPI should be dismissed. The CA ruled that there was still a plain, adequate, and speedy remedy at the disposal of PDSPI. When the case reached this Court, the ruling was reversed and it was held that the CA erred in dismissing the petition for certiorari of PDSPI assailing the denial of its Memorandum on Appeal. 93 It must be stressed that in Puerto Del Sol Palawan, Inc.,the petition for certiorari assailing the NCIP-RHO Hearing Officer's order disallowing PDSPI's appeal, was filed in the CA. The NCIP-RHO Hearing Officer involved was coincidentally also, Gabaen. It was held that in challenging an interlocutory order or an order of the NCIP disallowing an appeal, a petition under Rule 65 was the proper remedy and that the CA was the proper court to resolve it. 94 To this Court's mind, there is no reason to depart from the doctrine of hierarchy of courts and the ruling in Puerto Del Sol Palawan, Inc.
II
Even if the doctrine of hierarchy of courts is relaxed, the petition of Santos failed to comply with the requisites of judicial review because she has no legal standing to bring a suit defending the validity of the RUP of PINPAL.
The requisites of judicial review include: (1) there must be an actual case or controversy; (2) it must be ripe for adjudication; (3) the person challenging the validity of the act must have standing to sue; (4) the question of constitutionality must have been raised at the earliest opportunity; and (5) the issue of constitutionality must be the very lis mota of the case. 95
The requisite of actual case or controversy is present ""when there is a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims, susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute."" 96 It must involve issues that are definite and concrete and affect legal relations of parties with adverse interests. 97 It must also be demonstrated that there is grave abuse of discretion in the assailed governmental act in the context of actual, not merely theoretical, facts. 98 The right sought to be enforced through the exercise of judicial review is inextricably linked to the other requisites, particularly a party's legal standing.
Anent the requisite of legal standing, the complaining party must demonstrate a direct injury already sustained or immediately in danger of sustaining as a result of the act complained of. Here, this Court finds that Santos has no legal standing to institute a suit defending the validity of the RUP of PINPAL.
In Falcis III v. Civil Registrar General,99 this Court defined legal standing as:
x x x a party's ""personal and substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement."" Interest in the case ""means a material interest, an interest in issue affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest."" 100 (Citations omitted)
The requirement of legal standing is imposed to ensure ""that a party is seeking a concrete outcome or relief that may be granted by courts."" 101 It is based on the principle of separation of powers as it spares the ""unnecessary interference or invalidation by the judicial branch of the actions rendered by its co-equal branches of government."" 102 It is also intended to prevent the courts from indiscriminately being exposed to all types of suits that may unduly overburden the dockets. 103
This Court highlighted in Falcis III 104 that:
[w]hether a suit is public or private, the parties must have ""a present substantial interest,"" not a ""mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest."" Those who bring the suit must possess their own right to the relief sought. 105
The foregoing rule applies even to non-traditional suitors such as taxpayers, legislators, or concerned citizens, who must still claim some kind of injury-in-fact or concrete interest in the outcome of the dispute. 106
Moreover, Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court provides that a real party in interest is one ""who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit.""
In Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines v. Hon. Mendoza,107 the petition for review on certiorari filed by purported non-life insurance agents and underwriters was denied due, among other reasons, to their lack of legal standing to challenge the constitutionality of an issuance by the Department of Transportation and Communication. This Court ruled that the petitioners failed to establish legal standing as associations suing on behalf of their members. While their respective certificates of incorporation were presented, it was not shown that they were authorized to represent their members in the protection of their insurance business. The same can be said about Santos. She could not simply institute a case defending the validity of the RUP of PINPAL without being authorized by the organization to sue on its behalf. Santos failed to demonstrate to this Court that she possesses the requisite authority to represent PINPAL. AaCTcI
Meanwhile, in the case of Real v. House of Representatives,108 this Court dismissed a petition filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeking to compel the House of Representatives to facilitate the proceedings in relation to the renewal of a corporation's legislative franchise. In dismissing the petition, this Court reiterated that only those who sustained a direct injury or is in danger of suffering damage from the assailed acts may bring a suit to Us. This Court also noted that the corporation seeking a renewal of its legislative franchise had already instituted a separate proceeding. 109 This ruling can be applied by analogy to the petition of Santos. Since PINPAL has the more direct and specific interest in the validity of its RUP than Santos, her petition must be dismissed.
While Santos may have an indirect interest, as a buyer of the almaciga resins, this interest is only incidental as compared to the interest of PINPAL — the holder of the RUP. As pointed out by the OSG, her interest does not qualify as that contemplated to warrant the exercise of judicial review because it arises only from her alleged exclusive dealership with PINPAL, and not from the RUP itself. Santos has no direct or personal right prejudiced by the nullity of the RUP granted to PINPAL. 110 Thus, she is not in the position to ask for injunctive relief against the proceedings for the validity of the RUP before the NCIP-RHO.
III
Finally, on the question of constitutionality of Section 3 (a) of R.A. No. 8371, in Parcon-Song v. Parcon,111 it was held that courts should avoid resolving the constitutionality of a law if the case can be ruled on other grounds. Speaking through the ponencia of Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen, this Court explained that:
As a rule, the courts will not resolve the constitutionality of a law, if the controversy can be settled on other grounds. The policy of the courts is to avoid ruling on constitutional questions and to presume that the acts of the political departments are valid, absent a clear and unmistakable showing to the contrary. To doubt is to sustain. This presumption is based on the doctrine of separation of powers. This means that the measure had first been carefully studied by the legislative and executive departments and found to be in accord with the Constitution before it was finally enacted and approved.
xxx xxx xxx
The judicial review requirement that a constitutional issue seasonably raised should be the lis mota of the case is rooted in two constitutional principles: first, the principle of deference; and second, the principle of reasonable caution in striking down an act by a co-equal political branch of government.112 (Emphases supplied; italics in the original)
Similarly, in Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines v. Hon. Mendoza,113 this Court emphasized that constitutional issues raised in a case will not be passed upon ""when it is not the lis mota.More so, when it can be resolved on some other ground."" 114
Here, this Court deems it proper to refrain from deciding on the constitutionality of Section 3 (a) of R.A. No. 8371 and its counterpart provision in Section 1, Part II, Rule III of its IRR, as the grounds of non-observance of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts, and the absence of legal standing are enough reasons to dismiss the petition.
In view of the foregoing limitations, there is no reason for this Court to take cognizance of the present petition.
WHEREFORE,the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Anita Santos against respondents Atty. Kissack B. Gabaen, Ricardo D. Sanga, and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, Department of Environment and Natural Resources is DISMISSED.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, plaintiff-appellee, vs. MA. CONSUELO TOROBA PALMA GIL-ROFLO, * JERICO O. EBITA, NORMAN JAY JACINTO P. DORAL, DERRICK P. ANDRADE, SERGIO U. ANDRADE and CHONA ANDRADE TOLENTINO, accused-appellants.
DECISION
HERNANDO, *** J p:
Before this Court are consolidated appeals 1 filed by accused-appellants Ma. Consuelo T. Palma Gil-Roflo (Roflo), Jerico O. Ebita (Jerico), Norman Jay Jacinto P. Doral (Norman), Derrick P. Andrade (Derrick), Sergio U. Andrade (Sergio) and Chona Andrade Tolentino (Chona), assailing the November 29, 2018 Decision 2 and August 28, 2019 Resolution 3 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-06-CRM-0025 to 0029, for violation of Sec. 3 (e), Republic Act No. (RA) 3019, 4 and SB-06-CRM-0030 to 0034, for Estafa Through Falsification of Public Documents, defined and penalized under Article 315, paragraph (1) (b), in relation to Articles 171 (4) and 48 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
Version of the Prosecution:
Raul M. Antopuesto (Antopuesto), a media practitioner in Davao, filed a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman regarding the alleged ghost employees in the office of Roflo, then a Sanggunian Panlalawigan member of the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental, Province of Davao Oriental. Antopuesto claimed that Rosie Bajenting (Bajenting), former Administrative Aide Officer III in the Office of Roflo in Davao Oriental, informed him that accused-appellants Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, are ghost employees of Roflo. 5
On the strength of Antopuesto's complaint, the Office of the Ombudsman recommended the filing of criminal charges against Roflo with the Sandiganbayan for violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, and Estafa Through Falsification of Public Documents. The Information was later amended to include Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, all of whom were allegedly job order employees assigned at the Satellite Office of Roflo located in Davao City, during the period from 2001 to 2003.
The Informations alleged that Roflo, as a member of the Sanggunian Panlalawigan Davao Oriental, conspired with Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, by making it appear that they are legitimate job order employees in the office of Roflo, when it truth, they worked as house helpers of Roflo and her family in their houses in Davao City. Bajenting averred that she was instructed by Roflo to submit the names of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, to the Human Resources Department (HR Department) for the issuance of contracts of services in their favor, representing them to be job order employees of Roflo. Bajenting signed the contract of service of Chona while a certain Bobong Morales (Morales) signed in behalf of Jerico, Norman, Derrick and Sergio. 6
Bajenting prepared the Daily Time Records (DTR), Accomplishment Reports (AR), time book, payroll and other supporting documents relative to the employment of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona. Similar to the contracts of service, Bajenting signed the DTR and AR of Chona while Morales signed for Jerico, Norman, Derrick and Sergio. 7 Utilizing the falsified DTRs and ARs, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, were able to collect salaries from the provincial government of Davao Oriental, to the damage and prejudice of the government. Roflo instructed Bajenting to claim the salaries of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, by virtue of a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) executed by Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, and that a few days after receipt of the said salaries, Roflo would give the same bundle of money back to Bajenting for the latter to deposit it to Roflo's personal bank account at the Mati Branch of the Philippine National Bank. 8
On cross-examination, Bajenting admitted that Roflo dismissed her (Bajenting) from the service on February 19, 2003, for certain anomalies she committed in the performance of her duties. As a consequence, criminal charges were filed against her for Qualified Theft and Falsification 9 between March 6-10, 2003. Bajenting filed the instant complaint against Roflo on March 26, 2003, days after the Qualified Theft and Falsification cases were filed against her by Roflo and former Governor Elena Palma-Gil (Palma-Gil). 10
The prosecution also established through the testimony of Carmencita E. Vidamo (Carmencita), Vice President for Students Personnel Service, and concurrent University Registrar of the University of Mindanao in Davao City, that Derrick and Sergio were enrolled in the University of Mindanao for the school year 2002-2003 and 2001-2002, respectively, as evidenced by their transcript of records submitted before the trial court. 11
Version of the Defense:
For her defense, Roflo claimed that Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, were legitimate job order employees of the provincial government of Davao Oriental assigned in her (Roflo) Satellite Office in Davao City during the period relevant to the case. The said satellite office was established in 1992 when her mother was still the representative of the first district of Davao Oriental. The purpose of the satellite office was to provide public service to her constituents in Davao City. Specifically, the satellite office gives assistance to the indigent patients of Davao Medical Center requiring financial help, transportation assistance, and medical needs. 12 The satellite office was open 24 hours a day to cater to the needs of their constituents especially in cases of emergency. 13
As to the functions of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, Roflo claimed as follows:
1. Sergio acted as a security aide and radio operator in the satellite office; 14
2. Chona managed the satellite office. She was in-charge of the bills and the filing of documents; 15
3. Derrick acted as an alternate security aide and assigned to operate the telephone and fax machine. He also entertained walk-in constituents in the satellite office; 16
4. Norman functioned as researcher and liaison officer. Part of his job was to go to Manila to follow-up on requests for funding for the projects of the province; 17 and
5. Jerico also performed research work for Roflo. In addition, he was designated by Roflo to look for suppliers offering the lowest prices. He also helped in entertaining walk-in constituents in the satellite office. 18
Roflo did not impose specific work hours to Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, because a job order employee is not considered a government employee, hence, is not required to report during the prescribed office hours like regular employees, as long as they rendered work for eight hours a day. Further, they can be assigned any task that they are capable of and may be assigned anywhere, even outside the province. 19
Derrick was a working student who finished only one contract of service because he had difficulty juggling work and studies at the same time. 20 Sergio was also a working student. She employed Sergio because she wanted to help him fulfill his dream of becoming a police officer. 21 Roflo constantly monitored her job order employees especially Derrick and Sergio to make sure that their studies did not interfere with their work in the satellite office. She would regularly call them by phone or through the radio during weekdays to ensure that they were doing their respective tasks. Her job order employees worked even beyond 5:00 p.m., and even during weekends as she would see them personally whenever she is in Davao City since the satellite office was open 24 hours every day. 22
Chona did not work as her house helper; she has a household help in the satellite office in the person of ""Nang Ilyang"" who had been her nanny when she was still a baby. 23
Anent the DTRs of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, reflecting their time worked as 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., these were prepared by her staff stationed in her office in Davao Oriental, but were personally signed by the concerned job order employees, contrary to the claim of Bajenting that she and Morales signed the same. The DTRs were intended merely for the processing of the salaries of the job order employees. Job order employees were not required, as a matter of policy, to submit DTRs as they are not considered government employees pursuant to the provisions of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 02-0790, 24 and as provided in their contracts of services as job order employees. 25
Admittedly, the DTRs of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, did not necessarily reflect their true time of arrival and departure because they were practically living in the satellite office as they stayed there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, accused-appellants Sergio, Derrick and Chona in particular. 26 They indicated their time of arrival as 8:00 a.m. and time of departure as 5:00 p.m. pursuant to the advice of the HR Department in accord with the agency's prescribed office hours. 27 Moreover, if the job order employee submitted a DTR indicating hours of work other than 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., the same would be returned to the concerned employee by the Accounting Office. Thus, it has been the practice of each and every job contract employee to indicate their time in and out as 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., respectively. 28
The ARs of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, were similarly prepared by the staff in her Davao Oriental office but were signed personally by Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona. The AR is just a requirement for the processing of the job order employees' salaries.
From August to September, 2002, Norman was tasked to follow up on Roflo's office's request for funding with the House of Representatives in connection with the construction of Davao Oriental's provincial capitol building. During this time, Norman was reviewing for, and taking the Bar examinations. 29
Roflo pointed out that the complaints against her was ill motivated because she dismissed Bajenting from her employment after she discovered her anomalous transactions, e.g., altered disbursement vouchers for medicines, supplies and hardware, and failed to remit to Roflo her salary for the period of January 16 to 31, 2003. 30 Consequently, Bajenting was charged with Qualified Theft and Falsification before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and Municipal Trial Court (MTC), respectively, of Davao Oriental. This was corroborated by Palma-Gil, former Board Member, Representative, and Governor of Davao Oriental. 31 In support thereof, Palma-Gil introduced a certified true copy of the Joint Decision dated September 4, 2015 of the MTC of Davao Oriental finding Bajenting guilty of Falsification. 32
Reynaldo T. Bicoy (Bicoy), Human Resources Manager (HR Manager) of the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental, confirmed that there is no rule prohibiting the assignment of job order employees outside the province. Working students were also not disqualified to become job order employees. 33 For job order employees assigned in far-flung municipalities, it has been the practice that their DTRs and ARs are prepared by the designated payroll clerk of the office for convenience, and that the same would only be sent to the concerned job order employees for their signature. 34
Bicoy acknowledged that pursuant to Civil Service Resolution No. 020790, the provision in the contracts of service of the province's job order employees which mandated the rendition of service during the agency's prescribed office hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., was deleted. The Accounting Office would not receive the DTRs or payrolls if the prescribed working hours of 8:00 to 12:00 and 1:00 to 5:00 were not stated. 35
Morales, Administrative Assistant III, and a job order employee in the Provincial Health Office, denied having signed the contracts of services, DTRs and ARs of Jerico, Derrick, Sergio and Norman. 36 His office was located in a different building from that of Bajenting which is around 100 meters away.
Josephine S. Bandigan (Bandigan) also denied the allegation that she wrote entries in the DTRs of Sergio and Chona. In 2001, Bajenting was assigned in the Sanggunian Panlalawigan office while she worked in the Governor's Office. The distance between the two offices was quite far such that it would take around 10 minutes to traverse the same through public mode of transportation. 37
Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, uniformly corroborated the testimony of Roflo that they were Roflo's legitimate job order employees. Their DTRs and ARs were prepared by the Office of Roflo in Davao Oriental but they signed the same personally. The said documents were brought to them personally by Fidela Toroba (Fidela), the private secretary of former Governor Palma-Gil whenever she visits the satellite office twice or thrice a week to monitor the job order employees. They signed the DTRs reflecting their time in and out as 8:00 o'clock a.m. to 5:00 o'clock p.m. as per the directive of the Accounting Office, and that if they indicated a different time, the same would be rejected and returned to them for correction. 38 Otherwise, their salaries will not be processed and paid to them. They believed that they are merely required to render service for 40 hours per week without need to comply with the prescribed official time. 39
Moreover, Derrick claimed that their work in the satellite office entailed no specific hours of the day as they were accepting requests for hospitalization, financial assistance, and other miscellaneous requests, day and night, as the need arose. 40 On the difference of his signatures, Derrick explained that he changed his signature when he applied for coverage with the Social Security System because he just wanted to change it. 41
On the other hand, Sergio testified that although he was a working student at the time he was employed as job order employee, his schedule in school allowed him to perform his job when he had no classes. If his schedule of classes is in the morning, he would work in the afternoon and vice versa. On the issue of his signatures, he admitted that he changed his signature when he applied for a job in the Philippine National Police. 42
For her part, Chona denied that she was the nanny of one of the children of Roflo. It was the house helper, Nanay Enyang Bongac, who did the cleaning and maintenance of the satellite office. However, just like any office set-up, Chona also helped. 43 She claimed that she was a stay-in employee in the satellite office and that they sometimes worked beyond 5:00 p.m. especially in times of emergency. 44
Jerico testified that he worked as a Clerical Assistant and Legislative Staff in the satellite office. His tasks included doing research, canvassing of low priced supplies and other errands as assigned by Roflo. He usually reports to the satellite office from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. but whenever Roflo is in Davao City, Jerico would render services beyond 5:00 p.m. 45 When asked about his signatures, Jerico answered that he changes his signature from time to time, and has not perfected the same even at present. 46
For his defense, Norman averred that his taking the Bar Examinations in 2002 was not a hindrance in the performance of his functions. The examinations were conducted only every Sunday for the whole month of September, hence, he had the weekdays to follow up the requests for funding with the House of Representatives. The signatures appearing on his Judicial Affidavit, DTRs and ARs were all his. He has three different signatures and would usually change his signatures because they were easy to imitate. 47
Fidela, the private secretary of Palma-Gil, claimed that she was assigned at the first satellite office of then Representative Palma-Gil in Bajada, Davao City from 1992 to 1998. When the satellite office moved to its new location at Greenheights Garden Village, Diversion, Buhangin, Davao City, she also transferred therein from 1998 to 2001. Her duties and responsibilities included working closely with the other staff in the satellite office in providing assistance to the constituents of the first district of Davao Oriental. 48 The satellite office was established to receive letters and communications from officials of the government as well as the constituents of Davao City. The office extended financial, medical, funeral, emergency and other assistance to the residents of Davao City, and that the office was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 49
When Palma-Gil was elected Governor of Davao Oriental, Fidela became her (Palma-Gil) private secretary. Fidela was also given a special assignment to continue supervising the satellite office in Davao City from 2001-2007 together with the job order employees of Roflo. This required her to travel to Davao City two to three times a week. Fidela regularly brought the salaries, as well as the DTRs and ARs of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, for their signature. The signatures of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, on their contracts of services, DTRs and ARs were not forgeries as she personally witnessed them signing the same in the satellite office. She constantly supervised the subject job order employees whenever she travels to the satellite office. 50

SO ORDERED. 51
The Sandiganbayan, however, exonerated Roflo from the charge of Estafa with Abuse of Confidence for failure of the prosecution to establish all the elements of the crime. 52
The Sandiganbayan found accused-appellants to have conspired with one another in committing the crime of Falsification of Public Documents. The elements of the crime were sufficiently established by the prosecution. First, that Roflo is a public officer at the time material to the case. Second, a DTR is a public document that anyone who accomplishes it has the legal obligation to faithfully and truthfully state the data required therein. Third, the entries in the DTRs and ARs of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, which were certified correct by Roflo were absolutely false considering that they did not actually render service. Fourth, Despite the non-rendition of work, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, received salaries to the damage of the government. Fifth, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona uniformly claimed that they signed their contracts of services, DTRs and ARs, and admitted that they received their respective salaries. 53
The Sandiganbayan found the signatures of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona in their contracts of services, DTRs and ARs as forgeries. Even if it were true that the signatures in the contested documents were genuine, they are still liable for Falsification of a public document for making untruthful statements, given that they admitted the falsity of the time entries in their DTRs, and the trial court's finding that Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona never rendered service to the government, contrary to their claim in their ARs. 54
All the elements of the crime of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 have also been established by the prosecution.
Roflo acted with evident bad faith when she repeatedly signed the DTRs, ARs and contracts of service of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona despite their non-rendition of work. As a result thereof, the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental suffered damage in the total amount of P349,250.00 representing the salaries of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona. Moreover, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona's participation in the conspiracy was similarly established by their admission that they received their salaries notwithstanding the fact that they did not actually render work for the government of Davao Oriental. 55
The separate motions for reconsideration of accused-appellants were denied by the Sandiganbayan in a Resolution 56 dated August 28, 2019 for lack of merit.
Aggrieved, accused-appellants Roflo 57 and Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona 58 lodged separate appeals 59 with the Court.
Issue
The sole issue before Us is whether accused-appellants are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 and for Falsification of Public Documents under Article 171 (4) of the RPC.
Our Ruling
We rule in the negative.
Only questions of law should be raised in petitions filed under Rule 45. 60 This Court is not a trier of facts. It will not entertain questions of fact as the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan are generally conclusive upon this Court. 61
This rule, however, admits of exceptions such as where: (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises and conjectures; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; and (5) the findings of fact of the Sandiganbayan are premised on a want of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record. 62
Here, accused-appellants assert that the Sandiganbayan committed a serious misapprehension of facts, and that their findings of fact are premised on a want of evidence, thereby wrongly concluding that accused-appellants are guilty beyond reasonable doubt. They argue that the evidence adduced by the prosecution falls seriously short of the quantum of evidence required to convict them.
With the backdrop of these assertions, We deem it proper to re-evaluate the factual findings and the conclusions reached by Sandiganbayan.
We held in Layug v. Sandiganbayan: 63
At the outset, it must be stressed that in all criminal prosecutions for offenses under the Revised Penal Code, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had criminal intent to commit the offense charged. As this Court said in Beradio vs. Court of Appeals:
Of great weight in Our criminal justice system is the principle that the essence of an offense is the wrongful intent (dolo), without which it cannot exist. Actus non facit ream, nisi mens set rea, the act itself does not make a man guilty unless his intentions were so. Article 3 of the Revised Penal Code clearly indicates that malice or criminal intent (dolo) in some form is an essential requisite of all crimes and offenses defined in the Code, except in those cases where the element required is negligence (culpa). 64
In every criminal case where the accused enjoys the presumption of innocence, an acquittal is warranted unless the accused's guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt. 65
Forgery was not substantiated by
clear, positive and convincing
evidence.
The Sandiganbayan convicted the accused-appellants for violation of Sec. 3 (e), RA 3019 and for Falsification of Public Documents citing as basis the ruling of this Court in People v. Macalaba, 66 wherein We decreed that:
Where the negative of an issue does not permit of direct proof, or where the facts are more immediately within the knowledge of the accused, the onus probandi rests upon him. Stated otherwise, it is not incumbent upon the prosecution to adduce positive evidence to support a negative averment the truth of which is fairly indicated by established circumstances and which, if untrue, could readily be disproved by the production of documents or other evidence within the defendant's knowledge or control. For example, where a charge is made that a defendant carried on a certain business without a license (as in the case at bar, where the accused is charged with the selling of a regulated drug without authority), the fact that he has a license is a matter which is peculiarly within his knowledge and he must establish that fact or suffer conviction. 67
The Sandiganbayan thus excused the prosecution from presenting evidence that will prove the guilt of accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt for the criminal charges filed against them ratiocinating that the charge of failure to render work is a negative averment which does not permit direct proof. As such, the burden of proof lies upon the defense to prove that they actually rendered work.
Using the above as yardstick, the Sandiganbayan found that accused-appellants failed to discharge the burden of proving that they indeed rendered service to the provincial government of Davao Oriental.
We are not persuaded.
We find that accused-appellants were able to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that they truly worked in the satellite office of Roflo in Davao City.
The defense submitted Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona's contracts of services showing that they were engaged by the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental as job order employees from 2001 to 2003. Their DTRs and ARs were likewise presented to substantiate the submission that they rendered work in Roflo's satellite office in Davao City during the time material to the case. Finally, their service records, as certified by the HR Department, were adduced to prove that they indeed worked as job order employees in the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental.
However, to support its finding that Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona did not actually render work, the Sandiganbayan took upon itself to examine their signatures in their contracts of services, DTRs and ARs, and went on to conclude that these were forged, thus, could not conclusively prove their rendition of work. In short, the Sandiganbayan relied primarily on the alleged forged signatures of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona in convicting them for violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019.
It is settled that the prosecution must establish the fact of falsification or forgery by clear, positive, and convincing evidence, as the same is never presumed. 68
Under Rule 132, Section 22 of the Rules of Court, the genuineness of handwriting may be proved in the following manner: (1) by any witness who believes it to be the handwriting of such person because he has seen the person write; or he has seen writing purporting to be his upon which the witness has acted or been charged; (2) by a comparison, made by the witness or the court, with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party, against whom the evidence is offered, or proved to be genuine to the satisfaction of the judge. Corollary thereto, jurisprudence states that the presumption of validity and regularity prevails over allegations of forgery and fraud.
In Lamsen v. People, 69 We decreed that ""[a]s against direct evidence consisting of the testimony of a witness who was physically present at the signing of the contract, and who had personal knowledge thereof, the testimony of an expert witness constitutes indirect or circumstantial evidence at best.""
As can be gleaned from the above-cited rule and jurisprudence, it is clear that the testimony of a witness who was physically present at the signing of the questioned document prevails over the comparison made by a witness or the court of the alleged forged handwriting or signature against the writings admitted to be genuine.
Here, Fidela testified affirmatively that she personally witnessed Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona sign their contracts of services, DTRs and ARs. Fidela categorically declared under oath that the signatures thereon were not forgeries as she was physically present at the time of signing thereof. 70 Juxtaposed with the comparison made by the Sandiganbayan of the subject signatures, which is considered only as circumstantial evidence, Fidela's testimony constitutes direct evidence as to the genuineness of the subject signatures on the subject documents. Accordingly, the plain comparison of the questioned signatures made by the Sandiganbayan cannot prevail over the direct evidence of Fidela, accused-appellants' witness, who testified affirmatively that she was physically present during the signing of the subject documents and thus, has personal knowledge thereof.
It is also worthy to stress that Morales and Bandigan denied under oath the allegation of Bajenting that they signed for and wrote the entries in the subject DTRs. 71
Moreover, in the light of accused-appellants' claim that their questioned signatures are their genuine signatures albeit they changed the same in the passage of time, coupled with the straightforward testimony of Fidela, a disinterested witness, that the subject signatures are not forgeries, the prosecution should have resorted to an independent expert witness who could ascertain the authenticity of the subject signatures, and who has the ability to declare with authority and objectivity that the questioned signatures are forged. Unfortunately, the records are bereft of any such analysis or even any attempt to have the signatures examined.
At any rate, the subject contracts of services were notarized, and it is a well-settled principle that a duly notarized contract enjoys the prima facie presumption of authenticity and due execution, as well as the full faith and credence attached to a public instrument. To overturn this legal presumption, evidence must be clear, convincing, and more than merely preponderant to establish that there was a forgery that gave rise to a spurious contract. 72 Here, no such evidence was presented.
Not only did the prosecution fail to present an expert witness to prove its allegation of forgery; it also utterly failed to present countervailing evidence to the defense's direct evidence consisting of Fidela's testimony that she personally saw Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona sign the subject documents. In sum, the prosecution failed to present clear, positive, convincing, and more than preponderant evidence to overcome the presumption of authenticity and due execution of the notarized contracts of services, and to prove that the signatures appearing thereon are forgeries.
Further, an examination of the signatures of Chona and Sergio reveals that there is a color of truth to their claims that they changed their signatures after their employment with Roflo. With respect to Chona, it appears that she got married after her contracts of service had expired, justifying her change of signatures. In her contracts of service, DTRs and ARs, Chona was still using Andrade. But after Chona got married to a Tolentino, it is understandable that she would change her signature to reflect her spouse's name. 73
As regards Sergio, the signature in the Deposit for Bail greatly differs from the signature in the Judicial Affidavit. The signature in the Deposit for Bail appears to be the same with the signatures in the contracts of service, DTRs and ARs while the Judicial Affidavit contains a different signature. 74 But Sergio maintained that these two are his genuine signatures. It is also incredible that Morales, the person who allegedly forged the signature of Sergio in the subject contracts of service, DTRs and ARs, again forged Sergio's signature in the Deposit for Bail which was executed in 2009, some eight years after the job order employment. 75 In spite of this, the Sandiganbayan made a sweeping declaration that the signatures of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona in their contracts of services, DTRs and ARs, were all forged without considering the above findings of this Court. 76 This We cannot countenance.
We find it apropos to echo the following pronouncement of the Court in Domingo v. Domingo 77 (Domingo) where We held that:
The passage of time and a person's increase in age may have decisive influence in his handwriting characteristics. Thus, in order to bring about an accurate comparison and analysis, the standards of comparison must be as close as possible in point of time to the suspected signature. As correctly found by the appellate court, the examination conducted by the PC-INP Crime Laboratory did not conform to the foregoing standard. Recall that in the case, the signatures analyzed by the police experts were on documents executed several years apart. A signature affixed in 1958 or in 1962 may involve characteristics different from those borne by a signature affixed in 1970. Hence, neither the trial court nor the appellate court may be faulted for refusing to place any weight whatsoever on the PC-INP questioned document report. 78 (Emphasis ours)
Likewise, as proclaimed by the Court in Cogtong v. Kyoritsu, 79 ""the standards should, if possible, have been made at the same time as the suspected document. The standards should embrace the time of the origin of the document, so that one part comes from the time before the origin and one part from the time after the origin."" 80
In this case, the Sandiganbayan used as standards of comparison the signatures in three documents, namely: contracts of services, DTRs and ARs executed between 2001 to 2003. We stress that these documents precede by six to eight years the Deposit for Bail of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, which were executed in 2009, and by 13 to 15 years their Judicial Affidavits which were executed in 2016. In short, the Deposit for Bail and Judicial Affidavits had been executed long after the execution of the questioned contracts of services, DTRs and ARs, and thus, the possibility of altering their signatures is not remote. Accordingly, as in the case of Domingo, this circumstance makes the Sandiganbayan's finding of forgery questionable.
There being no clear, positive and convincing evidence to substantiate the claim of forgery, the Sandiganbayan clearly erred when it refused to consider the service records of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, as certified by HR Manager Bicoy, stating that they actually rendered services in the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental.
Falsification of a public
document was not sufficiently
established by the prosecution.
On the finding that Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona are guilty of Falsification of a Public Document, the Sandiganbayan enunciated that they made untruthful statements when they indicated in their DTRs that they reported from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. when in truth, they did not. As regards Roflo, her complicity in the crime of Falsification of Public Documents consisted of her signing and certifying as true and correct the entries in the DTRs despite the same being false.
In holding accused-appellants guilty of Falsification of a Public Document, the Sandiganbayan noted that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties accorded to Roflo was successfully rebutted by the following pieces of evidence suggesting irregularity:
(i) Finding of the Sandiganbayan of forgery of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona's signatures on their DTRs, ARs and contracts of services;
(ii) The incomplete and inaccurate entries in their ARs;
(iii) The false entries in their DTRs; and
(iv) The testimonial and documentary evidence submitted to prove that Sergio and Derrick were working students during the subsistence of their contracts of services, and Norman's admission that he was reviewing for and took the Bar examinations from August to September 2002. 81
We do not agree.
As amply discussed above, the allegation of forgery was not sufficiently established by the prosecution.
We shall then delve into accused-appellants' culpability for Falsification of public documents on the basis of the alleged false entries in their DTRs.
Falsification of Public Documents has the following elements: 1) the offender is a public officer, employee, or notary public; 2) the offender takes advantage of his or her official position; and 3) the offender falsifies a document by committing any of the acts enumerated in Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code. To warrant a conviction for Falsification of Public Documents by making untruthful statements in a narration of facts under Article 171, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt the following elements: 1) the offender makes in a public document untruthful statements in a narration of facts; 2) he or she has a legal obligation to disclose the truth of the facts narrated by him or her; and 3) the facts narrated are absolutely false. 82
In Falsification of Public Documents, the offender is considered to have taken advantage of his or her official position in making the falsification when (1) he or she has the duty to make or prepare or, otherwise, to intervene in the preparation of a document; or (2) he or she has the official custody of the document which he falsifies. 83
Settled is the rule that Falsification of Public Documents is an intentional felony committed by means of ""dolo"" or ""malice"" and could not result from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight or lack of skill. 84 Intentional felony requires the existence of dolus malus — that the act or omission be done willfully, maliciously, with deliberate evil intent, and with malice aforethought. 85 This felony falls under the category of mala in se offenses that requires the attendance of criminal intent. 86 In fine, criminal intent is required in order to incur criminal liability under Article 171 of the RPC.
In this case, the element of malicious intent on the part of accused-appellants is sorely wanting.
As sufficiently established by the uniform testimonies of the defense witnesses, Roflo's satellite office in Davao City had been operating since 1992 to cater to the needs of the constituents of former Representative Palma-Gil in Davao City for convenience. This has been the constituents' go-to-place to ask for help. Said satellite office is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week to entertain requests for financial, medical, hospitalization, and other needs of the residents of Davao City, who do not have the means to travel to Davao Oriental to obtain the help that they need. It bears stressing that this fact had not been rebutted nor denied by the prosecution. In fact, Bicoy testified that the maintenance of satellite offices outside the provincial capitol of Davao Oriental. And the assignment of job order employees outside the province is not prohibited, but in fact is already an established practice. 87
Bicoy cited concrete examples of job order employees who did not strictly follow the prescribed office hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the rendition of work. For instance, doctors on job order status may report for duty for only two days straight equivalent to 48 hours and thereafter, they would no longer be required to report in the succeeding days of the week as they are deemed to have complied with the 40 working hours requirement. 88 The same is true with jail guards who were permitted to render work for more than eight hours per day. 89
Bicoy's and the defense witnesses' testimonies that job order employees have no prescribed working hours is further strengthened by CSC Resolution No. 020790 dated June 5, 2002 which effectively removed the requirement mandating job order employees to render service only during the agency's prescribed office hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 90
In this regard, Sections 1 and 3 of CSC Resolution No. 020790 dated June 5, 2002, the rule prevailing at the time of the subject contract of services pertinently provides:
Section 1. Definitions. — x x x
a. Individual Contract of Services/Job Order — refers to employment described as follows:
1. The contract covers lump sum work or services such as janitorial, security, or consultancy where no employer-employee relationship exists between the individual and the government;
xxx xxx xxx
3. The contract of services and job order are not covered by Civil Service law, rules and regulations, but covered by Commission on Audit (COA) rules;
4. The employees involved in the contract or job order do not enjoy the benefits enjoyed by government employees, such as PERA, ACA and RATA.
5. The services rendered thereunder are not considered government service.
xxx xxx xxx
Section 3. The contract of services, MOA or job order shall not contain the following provisions:
a. The employee performs work or a regular function that is necessary and essential to the agency concerned or work also performed by the regular personnel of the hiring agency.
b. The employee is required to report to the office and render service during the agency's prescribed office hours from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm or for forty hours per week.
c. The employee is entitled to benefits enjoyed by government employees such as ACA, PERA and RATA and other benefits given by the agency such as mid-year bonus, productivity incentive, Christmas bonus and cash gifts.
d. The employee's conduct shall be under the direct control and supervision of the government agency concerned.
e. The employee's performance shall be evaluated by the government agency. (Emphasis supplied)
A plain reading of the foregoing provisions of CSC Resolution No. 020790 shows that workers hired under job orders are not government employees. They do not enjoy the same benefits as government employees and their services rendered are not considered government service. More importantly, they are not, as a matter of course, required to work during the agency's regular hours. This is evident from Section 3 (b) of CSC Resolution No. 020790. Since there is no rule proscribing the rendition of work outside the agency's prescribed office hours, the logical conclusion is that they are permitted to work beyond 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., as long as they complied with the 40 hours weekly requirement.
This was confirmed by HR Manager Bicoy, a disinterested witness, who categorically testified based on personal knowledge that job order employees are not required to report during the agency's prescribed office hours, for as long as they completed the 40 hours per week of service. 91 According to Bicoy, the provincial government of Davao Oriental permitted this working arrangement such that all job order employees therein were under the impression that this guideline was correct and that they were allowed to adopt it.
Nevertheless, the government, through the CSC, COA and the Department of Budget (DBM) deemed it necessary to clarify the guidelines governing the hiring of workers under job contracts considering that the proliferation thereof gave rise to the following issues: a) lack of social protection for the workers and inequality in benefits, and b) obscure accountability of Job Order/Contract of Service workers due to lack of employee-employer relationship with the hiring agency. 92 Hence, the passage of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017. Paragraph 7.0 thereof provides:
7.0 Limitations
7.1 Hiring under contract of service shall be limited to consultants, learning service providers, and/or other technical experts to undertake special project or job within a specific period. The project or job is not part of the regular functions of the agency, or the expertise is not available in the agency, or it is impractical or more expensive for the government agency to directly undertake the service provided by the individual or institutional contractor.
xxx xxx xxx
7.4 The services of the contract of service and job order workers are not covered by Civil Service law and rules thus, not creditable as government service. They do not enjoy the benefits enjoyed by government employees, such as leave, PERA, RATA and thirteenth month pay.
Verily, the CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 reiterated that no employer-employee relationship exists between the government and job order employees, and that the services they render are not considered government service. In fact, they are not covered by Civil Service law, rules and regulations.
Bicoy's testimony stating that the job order employees are not required to work during the agency's regular office hours, and that if their DTRs did not reflect the official time of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., the same would not be accepted by the accounting office, was however, rejected by the Sandiganbayan on the ground that he was an incompetent witness to testify on this matter.
We beg to differ.
Bicoy is the HR Manager of the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental. As such, his office is responsible in the preparation of the contracts of services of workers under job contracts. He straightforwardly testified that they deleted the provision in the contracts of services which required the rendition of work from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. pursuant to Section 3 (b) of CSC Resolution No. 020790. As HR Manager, Bicoy has personal knowledge of this guideline, thus, was competent to testify on this matter especially because he signed as a witness to the contracts of services of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona. 93
Accused-appellants cannot be held criminally culpable for Falsification of Public Documents by making untruthful statements in a narration of facts in the absence of a clear showing that they acted with malicious intent when they affixed their signatures on the contested documents. To be sure, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, were acting in good faith and in the honest belief that they were permitted to work outside the agency's prescribed office hours pursuant to CSC Resolution No. 020790, and as confirmed by the HR Department.
In addition, they cannot be faulted for indicating in their DTRs that they worked from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. because this was the directive of the accounting office, otherwise, their salaries would not be processed. While it is true that the defense failed to present a witness from the Accounting Office to confirm this statement, We cannot just simply ignore the fact that accused-appellants consistently testified to this, which testimonies were sufficiently corroborated by HR Manager Bicoy.
Moreover, the Sandiganbayan's reliance in the Resolution of the Court in Ombudsman v. Elipe 94 (Elipe) is clearly misplaced. The respondent in Elipe was not a job order employee. Thus, she was required to report in the office during the agency's prescribed office hours. Based on the respondent's travel records obtained from the Bureau of Immigration, she left the country on October 25, 2013 and arrived back in the Philippines only on October 30, 2013. However, in her questioned DTRs, it was indicated that she reported for work on October 25, 29 and 30, 2013. Considering that the respondent was out of the country during such period, the Court held that it was physically impossible for her to have reported for and rendered work at that time. The Court also rejected the respondent's defense that she was only acting under the assumption that the act of falsifying one's DTR has ripened into practice. On this score, the Court enunciated that wrong does not cease to be wrong just because it has been adopted by the majority.
This case, however, is different from Elipe. For one, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona are job order employees who are not required to work during the regular office hours. For another, no such direct evidence, (i.e., travel records from the Bureau of Immigration), was presented in this case that will show that it was physically impossible for them to have rendered work in the satellite office, especially in the case of Chona and Jerico.
On the part of Derrick and Sergio who were admittedly enrolled in University of Mindanao at the same time they were employed as job order employees, We find that it was not physically impossible for them to render work because in contrast with Elipe, University of Mindanao is located only within the same locality where the satellite office is situated. Besides, they were stay-in workers in the satellite office, thus, it was not impossible for them to work before or after their classes. Surely, they are not at school all the time. An examination of their class schedules reveals that their classes in one semester were split into two terms.
For Derrick, his schedule for the first term of the first semester of school year 2002-2003 started from 8:00 a.m. and ended at 2:30 p.m., from Mondays to Fridays. During the second term, his class schedule was only in the morning from 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon. In the first term of the second semester, his schedule was from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. only. 95 Considering that the satellite office was open 24/7, it was not improbable that Derrick performed his duties after his classes. Further, Derrick's claim that he only completed one service contract from July 16 to December 31, 2002 96 because it was difficult for him to juggle work and studies at the same time, lends more credence to the fact that he actually rendered work in the satellite office.
The same is true with Sergio. Records show that Sergio's class schedules were mostly in the afternoon usually from 2:30 p.m. up to 8:30 p.m. It was only during the first term of the first semester of school year 2001-2002 that he had morning classes but the same ended at 1:30 p.m. 97 According to Sergio, if he had classes in the morning, he would render work in the afternoon and vice-versa. 98 Thus, working while at the same time studying was not unattainable for Derrick and Sergio.
With respect to Norman, testimonial and documentary evidence were adduced to support the claim that he has rendered work for Roflo even while he was reviewing for and taking the Bar Examinations in 2002. Records show that Norman was assigned in Manila from August to September, 2002 to follow up on the budgetary matters of the provincial government of Davao Oriental, particularly requests for financial assistance from the House of Representatives to fund the projects of the province. 99 In support thereof, Norman submitted Certifications 100 from the Offices of Representative Apolinario L. Lozada, Jr. (Representative Lozada, Jr.) and Representative Belma A. Cabilao (Representative Cabilao), certifying that Norman indeed made follow ups in their respective offices during the time indicated. Unfortunately, the Sandiganbayan rejected the said documentary evidence for being a mere afterthought and for having apparent doubtful intentions.
We do not agree.
The Certifications were issued by Representatives Lozada, Jr. and Cabilao in their official capacities as then members of the House. Thus, such certifications are considered as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein, and are therefore presumed to be truthful in the light of the prosecution's failure to present any plausible proof to rebut its truthfulness. The trustworthiness consists in the presumption of regularity of performance of official duty by a public officer. 101
Another circumstance distinguishing Elipe from this case is the fact that respondent therein admitted that the act of falsifying one's DTR has ripened into practice such that they thought that the adoption thereof by the majority has already validated the unlawful act. Here, the practice of indicating the time of arrival as 8:00 a.m. and the time of departure as 5:00 p.m. was not adopted by the job order employees at their own accord. Again, at the risk of sounding repetitive, the same was mandated by the Accounting Office of the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental such that non-compliance thereto would result in the non-processing and non-release of the job order employees' compensation. Simply stated, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona had no choice but to comply therewith, otherwise, they would not be paid their salaries.
Anent the inaccurate or lack of details in the ARs of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona, Roflo explained that the AR was merely an additional requirement imposed for the processing of the payroll. The job order employees were not the ones who prepared their respective ARs, they were merely asked to sign them in order to expedite the process.
HR Manager Bicoy again corroborated this when he testified that as a matter of practice, the ARs were prepared by the designated payroll clerk of the office and not by the job order employees themselves. The practice in their province was for the job order employees to write only general statements in the ARs such as ""doing assigned jobs,"" ""doing clerical works,"" or ""doing driving jobs."" 102 Meaning, such general statements were already sufficient compliance in the preparation of ARs. Bicoy was competent to testify in this regard because he also maintained job order employees in his office, thus, he has personal knowledge thereof.
Accordingly, no criminal intent may be imputed against accused-appellants for merely relying on previous practice. To reiterate, these customs or processes were already in place in the provincial government of Davao Oriental when Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona joined the agency. There is likewise no reason for them to distrust or to suspect the directives of the HR Department and the Accounting Office simply because they are authorities in this aspect.
Besides, workers under job contracts are not government employees and are not covered by Civil Service law, rules and regulations. In fact, Section 3 (d) of CSC Resolution No. 020790 provides that they are not under the direct control and supervision of the government agency concerned. Having no power of control over job order employees, the concerned agency cannot dictate the manner by which these employees should discharge their duties. Notably, they were not required to observe definite working hours, provided that they rendered at least 40 hours of service per week. To stress, job contract workers are not entitled to the benefits due to regular government employees, thus, it would be the height of injustice to require them to strictly comply with the rules governing government employees when they do not enjoy the same benefits given to regular employees. 103
Roflo did not act in evident bad
faith when she signed the
contracts of services, DTRs and
ARs of Jerico, Norman, Derrick,
Sergio, and Chona; neither did
Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio,
and Chona act in evident bad
faith when they received their
respective salaries.
With regard to the charge of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, the Sandiganbayan held that Roflo acted in evident bad faith when she repeatedly signed the DTRs, ARs, and contract of services despite their non-rendition of work which resultantly caused undue damage to the government.
""Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud."" 104 Moreover, ""evident bad faith"" connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. 105
We do not agree with the finding of the Sandiganbayan that Roflo acted in evident bad faith when she signed the DTRs, ARs, and contracts of services of Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona. As sufficiently established by the evidence on record, they were actually engaged by the provincial government of Davao Oriental under job contracts as evidenced by their service records and the testimony of Bicoy who signed as a witness to their contracts of services. Thus, they were legitimate job order employees of the agency.
Anent their contested DTRs, Roflo signed the same under the honest belief that the entries therein are what the Accounting Office require for the processing of the salaries of the concerned job order employees. Similarly, she signed their ARs on the notion that the statements therein were accurate and all that are required to support the claim of job order employees for compensation. Clearly then, Roflo's actions do not necessarily reflect fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. If what is proven is mere judgmental error on the part of the person committing an act, no malice or criminal intent can be rightfully imputed to him. 106
Similarly, Jerico, Norman, Derrick, Sergio, and Chona did not act in bad faith when they received their salaries from the provincial government of Davao Oriental. Having rendered actual services in the satellite office, they were clearly entitled to their salaries. Thus, there could be no manifest deliberate intent on their part to do wrong or to cause damage to the government agency.
In Ysidoro v. Leonardo-de Castro, 107 the Court upheld Mayor Ysidoro's acquittal of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 for the prosecution's failure to discharge its burden of proving that Ysidoro acted in bad faith, and the presence of the exculpatory proof of good faith. The Court held that the presence of badges of good faith on the part of Mayor Ysidoro negated the alleged bad faith.
Similarly, in People v. Bacaltos, 108 the Court exonerated Bacaltos from the charge of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 for failure of the prosecution to establish that evident bad faith or manifest partiality or gross inexcusable negligence, and on account of the exculpatory proof of good faith.
All told, We find that the prosecution utterly failed to prove accused-appellants' guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crimes charged thereby warranting their acquittal. While it is true that the trial court cannot dictate what particular evidence the parties must present in order to prove their respective cases, the fact remains that prosecution is still bound to present evidence that will support a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 109 We find and so hold that the prosecution clearly failed to discharge this burden.
WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution dated November 29, 2018 and August 28, 2019, respectively, of the Sandiganbayan in SB-06-CRM-0025 to 0029 and SB-06-CRM-0030 to 0034, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
Accused-appellants Ma. Consuelo Toroba Palma Gil-Roflo, Jerico O. Ebita, Norman Jay Jacinto P. Doral, Derrick P. Andrade, Sergio U. Andrade and Chona Andrade Tolentino, are ACQUITTED of the crimes of violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 3019, and Falsification of Public Documents under Article 171 (4) of the Revised Penal Code.
Let entry of judgment be immediately issued.

However, the proliferation of individual Job Order and Contract of Service workers in the government and their involvement even in the performance of regular agency functions have been observed.
This situation gave rise to the following issues: a) lack of social protection for the workers and inequality in benefits, and b) obscure accountability of JO/COS workers due to lack of employee-employer relationship with the hiring agency.
In view of the foregoing, there is a need to clarify the guidelines on availing of the services of COS and Job Order workers.
